FIBRALO BRUSH
a new fibre-tipped pen for a range of artistic effects

Fibralo Brush is the ideal artistic tool for anyone seeking the qualities of both a

fibre-tip and paintbrush. As a premium Swiss Made quality product, it enables

its fans to enhance their creativity. With a range of artistic and ultra-bright

colours based on food colourings. The ink in this fibre-tip pen is water-soluble

and therefore suitable for children aged 7 and over to use independently. The

fine artistic quality brush tip is certainly surprising. It is supple and bends and

folds before springing back to its original shape to enable the user to create

unlimited thick and fine lines in an instant. 

Available in 15 colours.

Our Artists of the Year 2015 competition closed with a flurry of 

last-minute entries and we’ve already started to sift through 

them here at A&I Towers. The format has changed slightly this 

year and we’ll be revealing the 50-strong shortlist in our next 

issue. The winners will then be announced at our exhibition at 

London’s Mall Galleries on 22-27 February 2016.

In the meantime, I was delighted to be asked to be a selector 

for the ING Discerning Eye 2015. This annual exhibition sees  

six collectors, artists and critics curate individual displays of smaller works.  

My fellow selectors included former Eastenders actor Larry Lamb and the ceramic 

designer Emma Bridgewater, who reveals her tastes in our interview on page 82.

Selecting work from the open submission was a fascinating process, as each  

of us wanted time to consider the relative merits of each piece, while also being 

sure to decide quickly enough to trump the other five – a few exceptional sets  

of paintings were snapped up in the blink of an eye. It encouraged an unusually 

instinctive approach to curating and should prove quite revealing as a result. You 

can see for yourself at Mall Galleries from 12-22 November. I hope you enjoy it!

ON YOUR BIKE
I’m a life-long cyclist who enjoys watercolour sketching. However, on 
long tours – such as the three weeks I spent in India earlier this year 
and the 10 days in the West Highlands this summer – there’s the 
problem of how to avoid weighty, bulky painting kit.

Trial-and-error has reduced this to two travel brushes, a three-deck 
watercolour set, an ergonomic pencil, a rubber, tissues, a tiny sponge 
and a small plastic bottle. These all fit into a toilet bag and weigh just 
half-a-pound. Water comes from my drinks bottle and I have a small, 
square Fabriano watercolour pad, too. There’s the added bonus that 
this same mini-kit also fits into my briefcase on business trips.
Gordon Casely, Crathes, Kincardineshire 

That’s a tidy bit of packing, Gordon! Share more of your painting tips and kit 
recommendations with us via the addresses opposite for the chance to join

ALL THAT SHE WANTS
Last year I changed my bank 
account and forgot to renew my 
subscription to your magazine.  
I have been meaning to for ages, 
but when you had an ad for a 
subscription including a free gift of 
a watercolour set, I took the plunge. 
Brilliant! A great magazine with 
such a lot of exciting articles and a 
lovely tin of full-pan watercolours – 
what more could a girl want?
Jenny Smy, via email

YOUR Letters…

LEt tER Of thE m O Nth

WHERE DID IT ALL BEGIN?
Re: Masterclass, Issue 356
I was fascinated to read Kate 
Osborne’s article on the use of a 
range of different brushes in floral 
painting and loved the results she 
attained [below left]. Unfortunately, 
what was otherwise an inspiring 
and useful article was spoiled, for 
me, by the lack of a photograph of 
the original bunch of flowers. 

It would have been most useful to 
see how the end result related to 
the original. I hope this criticism will 
be viewed as constructive and not 
negative. Keep up the good work!
Janet Mayo, via email

We’ve taken note, Janet. This month’s 
masterclass and demo both include a 
photo of the original subject and we’ll 
endeavour to do the same from now on. 

HEAD-SPINNING ART
As a direct result of reading your 
wonderful magazine earlier this 
year, I was privileged to spend two 
weeks in London, soaking up some 
of the magical exhibitions and 
culture. I booked my visit on the 
strength of a five-day workshop and 
the Sargent exhibition at the 
National Portrait Gallery, both of 
which were advertised in your 
magazine. While I was in London,  

I also saw Richard Diebenkorn and 
Rubens and His Legacy at the Royal 
Academy of Arts, Marlene Dumas at 
Tate Modern, Defining Beauty at the 
British Museum, Inventing 
Impressionism at the National 
Gallery and visited various other 
museums and galleries, too many  
to mention. My little South African 
head was spinning. 

Since my return, I’ve been hugely 
inspired and will continue to read as 
many books and magazines as I 
can, especially Artists & Illustrators. 
And hopefully I will return to visit 
London again very soon.
Sue Dickinson, Mpumalanga, 
South Africa

COLOUR YOUR WORLD
Re: Your Questions, Issue 356
I enjoyed reading the article by 
Adebanji Alade on plein air painting. 
I do a lot of plein air sketching 
myself but never use colour on 
location. However, having read 
Adebanji’s article, I intend to try.

When I am sketching, I use soft 
pencils or charcoal so I can produce 
quick, impressionistic sketches on 
heavyweight cartridge paper. 
Fortunately, my wife is keen on 
photography and she is able to take 
pictures of the scenes too.

There is nothing more enjoyable 
than sketching outdoors. One can 
forget all the tensions of modern 
life. I enclose a recent plein air 
sketch of a church at Treverbyn.

Artists & Illustrators contributor Alvaro Castagnet continues his watercolour world tour with a trip to 
Cuba this month for his latest DVD. After tackling the crumbling architecture of the Cuban capital in 
the first volume of The Passionate Painter in Havana, this second instalment (APV Films, £28.55), 
released this month, sees the Uruguayan painter turn his attentions to the many colourful characters 
he meets in the city’s cafés, barbershops and sun-soaked streets.  

Imbued with his trademark flamboyance and dynamism, Castagnet’s demonstrations show you 
how to capture the essence of a scene using a rich palette of colours and a series of decisive marks.

Artist and Empire
25 November to 10 April
Following disappointing reviews for Tate Britain’s 
other two major group exhibitions of 2015, 
Sculpture Victorious (“depressing”, according to 
The Telegraph) and Fighting History (“feeble and 
half-hearted”, so says The Guardian), there is 
plenty riding on Artist and Empire.  

Tackling art associated with the British Empire 
is certainly a provocative starting point. 
Hopefully the curators can reign in a wide-
reaching show that tackles questions of war, 
slavery and colonialisation, and features works 
by Sir Joshua Reynolds and Augustus John (his 
exemplary portrait of Colonel TE Lawrence, left, 
better known as ‘Lawrence of Arabia’).

Modern Scottish Women:  
Painters and Sculptors 1885-1965
7 November to 26 June 2016
Nicola Sturgeon would surely approve of this 
survey of art made in less enlightened times.  
The show begins in 1885, as Fra Newbery took 
charge of the Glasgow School of Art and 
welcomed many leading female tutors during a 
period of rapid expansion and success, and 
ends in 1965 with the death of Anne Redpath, 
the sole woman in the celebrated Edinburgh 
School. In between, a spotlight is shone on 
lesser-known talents such as Ayrshire-born 
engraver Agnes Miller Parker, represented by a 
rare tempera painting, Round Pond (Serpentine), 
pictured left.

art in the
outback

T
hink of Australia and visions 
of sizzling sunsets, rainbow 
coral reefs, chalky desert 
plains and eclectic wildlife 

spring to mind. Colours are saturated 
and intense, as you may expect an 
Aussie artist’s palette to be. Sydney-
born Glen Preece, however, prefers 
working with a softer range of hues 
that gives a continental European flair 
to his paintings of everyday scenes in 
New South Wales.

The reasoning behind this is partly 
climatic and geographic: Glen lives in 
the Southern Highlands, where the 
seasons are as defined as they are in 
any European country. Yet his works 
are also clearly inspired by Spanish, 
French and Italian artists too – the 
textures in The Road to My House 
remind us of a Monet landscape, for 
example, while Café appears to take 
compositional inspiration from 
Picasso’s portraits. 

“I guess I’m a traveller in terms of 
my influences,” says the 58-year-old. 
“I first started studying the Australian 
Impressionists but then I moved onto 
the French and Post-Impressionists 
before looking at Cubism and 
Fauvism. These days, my work is a mix 
of these movements – they have all 
the colour, light, strength and creative 
vision I look for in fine art.”

Born in Sydney in 1957, the young 
Glen had no inclination he would one 
day become an artist. His household 
wasn’t a conventionally creative 
environment – there were no books 
about art on the shelves and the only 
painting in the house was a “horrible 
print of a Mexican boy” – but the 
unique ochre landscapes resonated 
deeply with Glen.

As a boy, he thought becoming a 
geologist would be the best way for 
him to connect with the landscape.  
“I have always loved rocks and 
minerals, and I still collect them 
today,” he says. That all changed when 
he painted his first ‘serious’ painting 
at the age of 10. He was introduced 
and encouraged to explore his artistic 
side by his watercolourist aunt and the 
results were better than anyone, even 
Glen, could have expected.

“It was a large painting in acrylic of 
the Australian bushranger, Ned Kelly.  
I was so happy with the results that  
I painted two more with similar 
Australian themes,” he says. “I was 
fortunate to be able to exhibit them in 
Sydney and all three sold. Afterwards, 
I went straight to the local art shop 
and bought oils, brushes, canvases, 
an easel, a paint box – the lot!”

When it came to applying to college, 
studying fine art was a must. 

Drawing on boTh The moDern european masTers anD The

However, finding the right place wasn’t 
straightforward. He initially enrolled at 
Seaforth Technical College in 1975 
but found his objectives clashed with 
the tutors’ teachings. “It was when we 
were asked to throw paint at a canvas 
in the style of Jackson Pollock that I 
wanted to leave,” he says. “I was 
criticised by my tutors for being too 
traditional, so I thought it was time to 
enrol onto a different course.”

He settled upon a drawing course at 
Sydney’s prestigious Julian Ashton Art 
School, Australia’s oldest continuous 
fine art school. A year of classical 
training later and Glen felt confident to 
begin painting full time. 

His artistic talent was recognised by 
the late John Brackenreg, a prominent 
figure in 20th-century Australian art 
who had also studied at Julian Ashton. 
Brackenreg helped Glen to host his 
first solo exhibition in 1979 and the 
works sold out on the opening night.

“I felt so proud and excited,” says 
Glen. “I already had the passion but  
I knew from then on that I’d have to 
work extremely hard, and to keep 
painting, if I was going to succeed.”

Thirty-six years on and Glen is 
currently readying works for his fourth 
solo exhibition at London’s Panter & 
Hall gallery. He has established 
himself as one of Australia’s best-
known figurative artists; his works 
housed in collections around the 
globe and praised by The Sydney 
Morning Herald for his “knack of 
channelling the spirit of early 20th 
century Paris with a charming local 
twist”. It is his gift for conveying 
scenes of optimism that gives his 
artwork a global appeal.

and other visual stimuli, then locking 
them away in his mind until they’re 
ready to become a painting. “It helps 
to go straight to the canvas with my 
ideas,” he says. “I like the process of 
letting all these thoughts flow through 
me. When I was just beginning, 
another artist advised that I should 
paint as often as I could until the 
actual technical side of painting was 
no longer a worry, then everything 
becomes a pure release of the  
initial inspiration.”

Glen believes anything can be 
turned into a painting, which perhaps 
explains the breadth of his influences. 
However, it doesn’t always take a 
grand setting to set his imagination 
racing – sometimes all he needs is a 
good book. “I own hundreds of books,” 
he says. “A quick flick through any one 
of them normally triggers a reaction.” 

One book on Australian folklore, 

Marc Chagall has proven to be a 
great influence to Glen in this respect, 
as the Russian-French artist’s 
paintings often evoke feelings of 
happiness despite their deeper 
meanings. Alongside Amedeo 
Modigliani, Chagall is one of Glen’s 
artistic heroes and even indirectly 
inspired one of the Australian’s recent 
pictures. “The Man I Met Who Had 
Met Chagall is about a friend of mine 
who I met in a life drawing class,” 
explains Glen. “He was at a Chagall 
exhibition in Paris many years ago, 
standing in front of a small painting, 
and he was in awe of its beauty. He 
turned to an old man standing next to 
him to express his feelings and the 
gent said, ‘Thank you, I’m Marc 
Chagall’. The whole scenario made  
me very envious.”

Preece admits he’s like a sponge in 
this sense, forever absorbing stories > PH

bought for Glen by his wife Victoria, 
even inspired an entire collection.  
“I found there was a painting in every 
chapter, from stories of the colonial 
days and bushrangers to more 
modern stories. I was able to create 
an exhibition of some 40 works in 
2011 as a result, which was very 
successful.”

Above all, Glen draws his biggest 
inspirations from the Australian 
landscape. His most memorable 
journey, he says, was a three-week 
expedition into the Outback. “It’s 
weird when the most incredible place 
can be found in your own backyard 
– although at times, we were 10 hours 
drive to the next town,” he says. “We 
ate kangaroo tail and slept beneath 
the stars every night, which looked 
like a heavy blanket of glitter hanging 
over you. I came home with so many 
ideas for paintings – the work from 
that trip is the best I have ever done.”

Glen is an adventurer, picking up 
mementos from people and places, 
folk tales and history. His laidback 
approach is characteristically 
Australian, even if his palette is not. 
His latest exhibition promises to 
reveal a relaxed portfolio of quiet 
landscapes and intimate portraits that 
explore his vast homeland with ease.
Glen’s exhibition, Recent Painting, runs 
until 16 October at Panter & Hall, 
London SW1. www.panterandhall.com

Where do you make most of your work?
I split my time between my cottage in Edinburgh and  
my office in Speyside, Norfolk, where I used to live and 
where my business, St Jude’s Fabrics, is still based.  
I’ve got a room to work in at both locations. The most 
important thing for me is that I’m surrounded by my 
reference material, whether that’s an image I’m working 
from, work by other artists, or objects that I’ve found. 

How do you balance the business with making art?
I work a lot and I draw everyday. It’s hard but you find a 
way of doing it. If I’m going away for a few days, I’ll take 
a wood engraving because it’s portable or I’ll work on 
sketches for a design that I can work into a print in the 
studio. The work I produce for St Jude’s links strongly 
with my sketchbook so I can tell if a drawing will make a 
great idea for fabric or wallpaper. It’s a natural process.

You are curating an exhibition of relief prints for the 
Royal Society of Painter-Printmakers in November, 

part of a new series of annual, technique-specific 
shows. How is that going?
Really well. It’s good to have an exhibition that 
celebrates the different types of printmaking. It will be 
interesting to show the diverse range of images, subject 
and processes that can be developed.

Are you attracted to work that is similar to your own? 
Not always, there are a broad range of printmakers 
whose work I am interested in. You always pick up 
something new when you look at other people’s work 
because everybody does it differently. I use a lot of 
transparent ink, for example, but I like it when people 
use opaque inks. 

Do your changing surroundings influence your work?
Yes. I used to walk along the coast everyday when I

lived in in Norfolk so my work would feature plantains, 
reeds, cliff tops and salt marshes, but spending a lot of 
time in Scotland has affected the imagery. My prints 
are still botanical-based, but they feature more 
Scottish flora – you’ll see lots of birch trees, rowan 
trees, scabious and yellow rattle.

What colours are you naturally drawn to?
I find my Scottish prints often have a red tinge to them. 
Red rowanberries are indicative of a classic Scottish 
landscape and that bright red is something you won’t 
find in my Norfolk prints, which are more chalky to 
reflect the colour of the dried grasses and the sky.

How do you develop your subjects into a print?
I bring back all sorts of things to the studio, like shells, 
pebbles, driftwood, seed heads and feathers. I also 
like to sketch native plants in the landscape, not for 
botanical accuracy, but rather to capture the essence 
of the plant. If it’s a beautiful day, I’ll do watercolour 
and pencil crayon sketches, but if it is blowing a gale, 
I’d do more pencil sketches with colour annotations 
and add colour when I get back to the studio.

Are you quite organised in the studio? 
My print areas are always clean because they need to 
be and I have boxes that have specific items from 
certain places, like broken sea urchins and limpet 
shells from the Hebrides, but more often than not 
everything gets quite jumbled up. Wood engraving is 
great because you require so little space. It’s not like 
screenprinting where I need wash out areas and more 
space, especially as I use oil-based, transparent inks.

What’s your most treasured piece of equipment?
My wood engraving and lino tools, which I’ve had  
since I left college in the mid-1980s. I like having  
that continuity. There are so many beautiful things 
associated with wood engraving – the wooden blocks, 
the leather sandbags, the rollers – it is what attracted 
me to printmaking in the first place.

And what’s the most surprising item in your studio?
I’ve got lots of bit and pieces I’ve collected over the 
years, like a chunk of metal from an Orkney beach that 
came off a ship. I’ve got an Edward Bawden print above 
my fireplace – his work is something to which I aspire.

T
he Tate collection is arguably one of the most 
spectacular in the world, boasting more than 
70,000 works of art that date from 1500 to the 
present day. A trip to any one of the institution’s 

four galleries can leave you feeling inspired and in awe, 
if not a smidgen overwhelmed. 

In the basement of Tate Britain, however, there is a 
cornucopia of material that has quietly gathered alongside 
the permanent collection. Known simply as the Tate 
Archive, it houses over a million items – sketchbooks, 
letters, photos and more. The aim of this collection to shed 
light on the lives and practices of the UK’s favourite artists, 
from Ben Nicholson and Barbara Hepworth to John 
Constable and JMW Turner. Far from being a resource for 
academics only, it is a little known fact that the Tate Archive 
is accessible to all, available to the public by appointment.

With this in mind, we paid a visit to curator Adrian Glew 
to fi nd out what the Tate Archive had to offer. “I’ve been 
here since 1985 and I’ve been head of the Archive since 
2010,” he said. “I know the collections pretty well and I’ve 
written about Stanley Spencer so I’m a big fan of his work 
but there’s lots more to see.”

With Tate Britain bordering the Thames, we negotiated a 
set of watertight steel doors and Adrian guided us through 
what can only be described as a labyrinth of shelves and 

boxes. Rows upon rows of neat parcels decorate corridors 
as far as the eye can see, each with a unique reference 
number that corresponds with their place in the online 
catalogue. The boxes are fi lled with trinkets relating to a 
particular artist and Adrian picked out a few gems to give 
us a taster of the archive’s depth and variety. 

Boxes included some pristine Punch illustrations by 
Victorian artist Charles Samuel Keene and a poignant 
sketchbook of London life belonging to artist Felicia 
Browne, the fi rst British volunteer to die in the Spanish Civil 
War in 1936. Next up was a sketchbook belonging to the 
20th-century painter and printmaker John Piper. “A single 
volunteer has spent 10 years cataloguing everything 
belonging to Piper,” said Adrian. “There are 5,000 photos 
alone so it was a lot to get through. Lots of locations and 
timeframes are unidentifi ed so we always hope the public 
will get in touch if they can offer any information.”

As a contrast to Piper’s neat and meticulous sketchbook, 
we were shown one of Graham Sutherland’s energetic and 
unrefi ned notepads. The cover was splattered with bright, 
acidic oil colour and the pages were fi lled with vibrant 
sketches that suggested an idea for a painting without 
being too polished. It was comfortingly familiar to our own 
sketchbooks. However, perhaps the most impressive items 
in the archive were the six palettes that once belonged to

JMW Turner. The surfaces showed a few cracks where the 
wood has expanded and contracted over the years, but the 
splashes of oil paint still look surprisingly fresh. Being in 
the presence of such objects was a humbling experience 
that made this great master seem very real. 

The good news is that anyone can now experience seeing 
Turner’s palettes and all other material from the Tate 
Archive up close. Before you book an appointment, you fi rst 
need to register with the archive, as you would a local 
library. Membership is completely free and you can 
download a form from the Tate website beforehand to 
speed up the process. The next step is to look through the 
archive catalogue to pick out items that take your fancy. 
Tate has spent the last 18 months digitising large sections 
of the archive, so you can view nearly 100,000 items online 
from the comfort of your own home. Once you’ve found 
items for closer inspection, you can reserve up to fi ve 
pieces in advance by calling (020) 7887 8838 or emailing 
reading.rooms@tate.org.uk.

As well as the archive, Tate Britain also houses the Prints 
and Drawing Room, located on the upper fl oor of the Clore 
Gallery. This exceptional space holds artworks on paper 
from Tate’s collection and is split into fi ve categories – the 
Turner Bequest, the Oppé Collection, Historic British Art, 
Modern and Contemporary prints, and Modern and 
Contemporary drawings – all of which are available for 
viewing by the public too.

You can essentially take a journey through time here, 
from the Pre-Raphaelite Brotherhood to the Chapman 
Brothers. Better yet, the study room is fi lled with desks so 
you can sketch or paint from the original artworks (using 
pencil and watercolour only). It presents a rare opportunity 
to scrutinise some of the fi nest artworks ever created, 
without the restrictions of glass frames or jostling visitors 
that you might fi nd in a gallery. Book an appointment via 
(020) 7887 8042 or email studyroom@tate.org.uk.

The main draw in the Prints and Drawing Room is the 
Turner Bequest. A Tate registrar showed us a few of 
Turner’s sketches of Switzerland and Venice that were just 
a fraction of the artist’s 30,000 works on paper contained 
within. His studies of Mount Rigi by Lake Lucerne were 
painted 170 years ago, yet it was thrilling to be able to see 
in detail the artist’s dry, granulated brushmarks and soft 
washes of pigment. 

The Modern and Contemporary prints and drawings 
meanwhile are housed in a separate room across the 
corridor, with much larger storage facilities to 
accommodate the bigger sheets of paper that artists such

utilising post-1945. During our visit, we pored over etchings 
from David Hockney’s A Rake’s Progress series as well as 
the abstract expressionist paintings of Helen 
Frankenthaler, but there were still so 
many stones left unturned.

about theM that counts, as our 
coluMnist Laura BosweLL  explains

artist

try as we might, it is occasionally inevitable that things can go wrong when selling works to clients. Once there is a problem, it’s how you remedy the 
situation that can mean the difference between an 
unhappy customer who spreads negativity and a happy 
client who will trust you in the future. If, like me, you get 
a little flustered in this sort of situation, it is worth 
considering your potential responses so that you can at 
least appear calm and confident should the need arise.

It’s worth remembering that not all complaints are 
reasonable. One recent customer wanted to swap, at  
my cost, an old print for a new work, complaining he  
was now bored with his original purchase. There is no 
obligation to agree to such demands and the important 
thing is to refuse with good grace. I thanked him for 
admiring my new work and refused with a smile, making 
sure I didn’t leave him feeling foolish or defensive. 

When it comes to more reasonable complaints, such 
as damage in transit, delivery or incorrect orders,  

I always accept that it is my responsibility to resolve the 
problem at my cost. This means ensuring that I have 
appropriate insurance cover (public liability insurance 
where necessary) and accepting that occasionally I will 
sacrifice profit in the name of good customer relations. 

An unhappy client can be trickier. The best strategy  
is to remain calm and let them explain exactly what is 
making them unhappy in their own time, resisting the 
temptation to offer a flurry of excuses. Check you 
understand the problem, asking for time to think if you 
need it. If it is your fault, simply say so, apologise without 
any attempts at self-justification and offer a solution at 
your expense. In addition to this, I try to go a bit further 
than simply ‘making good’. This may mean refunding all 
instead of some postage costs, giving a small discount 
or popping some greetings cards in with an order just to 
show that I care. That way I know I have done my best 
for my clients – and my own peace of mind too.

Yes, my feeling for colour remained important: I designed 
clothes as though they were paintings. When I resumed 
painting later, I found that working with so many brilliant 
photographers had sharpened my eye for composition.

You have an extraordinary garden at your current London 
flat. Are your surroundings reflected in your paintings?
I moved here after I was declared bankrupt. You don’t 
expect disasters like that to throw up something especially 
magical but it did. I was petrified when they moved me to 
this estate but now don’t think that I would ever like to 
leave. As soon as I came here, I planted 29 trees to give 
me privacy and it now feels as though I am living in a 
landscape. It taught me I didn’t have to get on the train 
down to Wales to paint leaves and trees.

How has your style changed in recent years?
These days I don’t have a studio and I have neither the 
space nor the 
funds for big 
canvases so I 
have turned to 
working on paper 
and creating 
prints of my 
paintings by 
digitally adding 
acid colours. I’ve 
called this series 
of works After 
Warhol, so I 
suppose, in the 
end, he did 
influence me.

What attracted you to the acidic colours?
I’m obsessed with those colours now because I recently 
had a cataract operation, which was the most important 
thing, creatively speaking, that has happened to me in a 
long time. After the operation, I found myself living in a 
technicolour world. Why would I want to continue painting 
faintly sombre landscape paintings when this new way of 
working is more in tune with how I am now? In the past I 
was idyllically happy being a painter and that has returned. 
Suddenly, at 83, I’m experiencing a new departure.
Molly’s exhibition runs until 14 November at Galerie Simpson, 
Swansea. www.mollyparkin.co.uk

When and how did your love of painting begin? 
Nobody knows because there wasn’t another artist in our 
family, but I’ve been artistic since I was a child. I was born 
on the side of a mountain in the Garw Valley in South Wales 
and, when I was a very small child, my grandfather took me 
to the top of the mountain and acquainted me with 
skyscapes. The sky has always been very important in my 
work because of this. I was also very keen on swimming, 
especially in the ocean, and that gave me an understanding 
of how to paint the movement of the waves.

In your younger days you hung out with Andy Warhol and 
Francis Bacon. Did they influence your art at all?
One thing that did influence me was Francis Bacon’s 
dedication – he would get up at four in the morning to work. 
However, neither of them influenced my art at that point 
because I wasn’t painting at all: I had a 25-year period in 
which I lost my muse. It happened when I kicked my first 
husband out for infidelity in 1963. I was a very successful 
painter at the time – my paintings had bought us a house in 
London. The shock of the infidelity was so strong that, after 
my husband left, I went upstairs to my studio and stood 
there with the palette and the brush in my hand, but 
nothing came at all.

When did your ability to paint return?
It came back 25 years later, a couple of months after I 
joined Alcoholics Anonymous. One summer evening I was 
walking back from an AA meeting at Marble Arch. It was  
an incredible sunset, and a wave of grief swept over me.  
My granny’s voice came to me, telling me to take out the 
envelope and pencil I had in my bag, and make a sketch.  
I was still sitting there sketching at 11pm. The next day  
I bought a set of watercolours and a little palette and 
started making paintings again. Shortly afterwards, I went 
on a trip to the Arctic and The Telegraph commissioned me 
to paint what I saw. I sold all but two of those paintings.

How should an artist go about nurturing creativity?
I would like to stress how important it is to move among 
kindred spirits: it brings out what you both share and what 
is most precious to you. My friendship with Quentin Crisp, 
for example, meant a lot to me.  

You forged a very successful career in fashion, first as a 
designer at Biba and then as an award-winning journalist. 
Were there any parallels with your art?

Vision On the eve Of twO majOr exhibitiOns Of DaViD Jones’s watercOlOurs,  James Russell celebrates the artist-pOet’s unique take On the medium
connection to Welsh history and culture. From his mother, 
who had been raised in bustling Rotherhithe, he inherited a 
love of the sea and ships, and a talent for drawing. Both 
parents believed strongly in the value of culture and 
encouraged their artistic son despite their fears for his 
financial future; so precocious was he that by the age of  
14 he was enrolled at the Camberwell School of Art. 

Then came the Great War – his ‘parenthesis’. From 1915 
to 1918 Jones served on the Western Front as an infantry 
soldier, refusing to put in for a commission because he 
loved the camaraderie of the ranks, and surviving notably 
bloody battles – the Somme, Ypres and Passchendaele. 
The full effects of this experience would emerge only slowly. 

d
avid Jones was that rare thing: an artist-poet 
who was equally skilled in both disciplines, 
producing paintings filled with poetic rhythms and 
verse rich in visual imagery. To literary people, 

such as his friend and publisher TS Eliot, he was one of the 
most important poets to emerge from The Great War; his 
full-length verse drama In Parenthesis was a modernist 
classic. But he was a visual artist first and foremost – a 
watercolourist whose work is quite unlike anyone else’s.

Born in Brockley, Kent in 1895, the youngest of three 
children, Jones enjoyed a happy and stable childhood. His 
father, a Welsh non-conformist, worked as a printer on the 
Christian Herald, and instilled in him a deep sense of

lyrical freedom, allowing the 
influence of André Derain and 
Henri Matisse to come to the fore. 
A visit to Lourdes proved 
disappointing in the spiritual sense, 
the place so overwhelmed with 
knick-knackery that he likened it to 
Woolworths, but as an artist he 
nevertheless responded with a 
painting entitled simply Lourdes. 

It is an unusual work. While the 
surrounding landscape is painted 
with Jones’s habitual freedom, the 
gothic architecture of the Upper 
Basilica is drawn in precise detail. 

Perhaps the aim was to offer this careful drawing as a 
manifestation of spiritual intensity, but the exaggerated 
arches and spires instead suggest an antique illustration of 
some fabled city.

On his return to Britain, David Jones began work on his 
epic Great War poem, In Parenthesis, while continuing to 
paint with increasing freedom – or, perhaps, under 
increasing pressure to experiment. In the late 1920s there 
was a widespread feeling that British artists were being left 
behind by their colleagues in mainland Europe, and one 
can sense from 1929 onwards that Jones was pushing 
himself harder and harder. He had always painted portraits 
and continued to do so, capturing a likeness of Eric Gill in 

More immediately, friendship with a Catholic chaplain set 
him on the road to conversion. By 1922 he was living with 
the artist Eric Gill and his family in the East Sussex village of 
Ditchling. 13 years his senior, Gill was, like Jones, a Roman 
Catholic and a believer in the union of art, life and religion. 

Although Jones served a kind of apprenticeship in Gill’s 
printmaking workshop, he took his cues as a painter from 
other sources. Early on he began tinting his drawings with 
watercolour and, by the late 1920s, he had become a 
master of this difficult medium. In this he was not alone. 
The cross-hatching in his early work suggests the influence 
of Paul Nash, a passionate advocate of the medium who 
inspired Eric Ravilious and Edward Bawden. 

Jones’s breakthrough as a painter occurred, appropriately 
enough, in the land of his fathers. In 1924, Gill abandoned 
Ditchling and dragged his family and a menagerie of 
animals to a disused monastery in Capel-y-Ffin, Wales, in a 
valley dominated by the towering peak of Y Twmpa. 

As an admirer of Samuel Palmer, Jones understood the 
significance of place, and Capel became to him what 
Shoreham was to Palmer: the inspiration for a dazzling 
creative burst. In paintings like Capel-y-Ffin, he adopted a 
simplified style reminiscent of Paul Cézanne or John Nash, 
introducing motifs that were personally significant. Trees 
are a constant feature of his work, with stumps and felled 
branches perhaps reminding us of his experiences on the 
Western Front, while the hut or shrine is a frequent visitor. 

One of the qualities that made Jones so different from 
his contemporaries was his lifelong fascination with Welsh 
and Arthurian myth and legend, an interest cultivated in 
childhood. The wild ponies grazing around Capel were, to 
his vivid historical imagination, perhaps related to the 
horses released in Wales by Arthur’s knights.

Other striking features of Capel-y-Ffin are the sinuous 
lines, a constant of Jones’s work through the early part of 
his career, and the palette, which is unusually strong for 
him but, in common with much of his work of the 1920s, 
lacking in greens. Indeed, this scene looks more like the 
south of France than it does Wales, reflecting a preference 
for landscape stripped to bare essentials that he shared 
with his innovative contemporaries.

There are clear parallels with Ben Nicholson in his 1928 
painting Table Top, from the skewed perspective to the wiry 
lines and the lack of concern for three-dimensional form. 
The palette once again is generally subdued, but there is a 
restless energy in his portrayal of the foliage; a feverish 
quality that would increasingly come to define his work as 
his mental condition deteriorated in the 1930s. Although 
never a naturalistic painter, he had in those years at Capel 
controlled the exuberance of his technique so that it 
enhances our experience of the places he depicted. 
Thereafter he moved quite quickly away from traditional 
representation into a visionary world. In his increasing 
disregard for solid forms he grew closer in spirit to 
Nicholson’s first wife Winifred, who, as a Christian Scientist, 
saw reality as a great illusion.

In retrospect, 1928 was something of a watershed year 
for David Jones the painter. In April he travelled with the 
Gills to the foothills of the French Pyrenees, journeying via 
Paris and Chartres. In the south of France his palette 
brightened considerably and he painted landscapes with a >

flowing lines and rubbed smudges of pigment. Increasingly, 
however, his sitters were becoming insubstantial, ghostly 
forms in rooms that threatened to fade into nothingness. 

Apparently less able (or willing) to work outside, he took 
one of Matisse’s favourite types of composition, the 
landscape viewed through a window, and took it in a new 
direction, dissolving walls and window frames so that 
interior and exterior blend into one and a vase of flowers 
seems almost to float on the waves beyond the window. 
Abandoning pencil and the wiry line work that had held 
earlier paintings together, he adopted loose, broken 
strokes, smudges and scribbles. His compositions became 
increasingly challenging, with every inch of the paper filled 
with forms that are reduced to outlines and dabs or 
blotches of colour. Whether this technique was deliberate 
or a symptom of mental disturbance is difficult to say. In 
1932 Jones suffered a severe breakdown, and, referring to 
it in later life, he wrote, “I was conscious for some long time 
before it came that I was straining every nerve to do 
something more than I had power to do.”

He recovered gradually, and with the successful 
publication of In Parenthesis in 1937 returned to painting. 
Like his poetry, the works he produced during World War 
Two require time and effort to unravel, so dense are they 
with incident and allusion. Often combining Arthurian 
legend, his own experiences of the previous war and his 

unfulfilled love for Gill’s daughter Petra, the paintings 
reward the patient viewer with poetic rhythms and 
passages of delicate beauty. 

David Jones lived until 1974, devoting most of his 
creative energy in the latter part of his life to writing, while 
pausing to paint memorable watercolours of trees and 
chalices. While his painting style continued to contrast 
loose brushwork with delicate drawing, he also produced a 
lengthy series of painted panels decorated with beautiful 
Latin text that resemble medieval manuscript pages. Even 
towards the end of his life, he was bringing the deep past 
into the present to create something beautiful and new. 
Some artists find a formula and stick with it, but not so 
David Jones. His choice of watercolour as a medium means 
that his work must be carefully stored and displayed only 
rarely, but we should not equate visibility with stature. 
Jones was one of the great innovators of 20th-century 
British painting, an inspiration to younger artists of his  
time and, in his melting architecture and smudge-filled air, 
a precursor of the Neo-Romantics.
David Jones: Vision and Memory runs from 24 October to  
21 February 2016 at Pallant House Gallery, Chichester. The 
Animals of David Jones runs from 24 October to 6 March 2016

talking techniq u es

the world-renowned american illustrator tells  steve Pill  how 
he has applied classical dutch painting techniques to modern pop 

culture icons as he embarks on a new personal project

t
homas Fluharty is an expert at pulling faces – 
just not his own. The world’s most famous 
actors, musicians and politicians are putty in 
the hands of this talented American artist.  
For more than 30 years, the Minnesota resident 

has wielded his brush to create a string of affectionate and 
charming character illustrations and storyboards for 
everyone from Coca-Cola to the New York Times.

In an era when caricatures are too often associated with 
jobbing sketchers sat on stalls in the tourist-trap piazzas of 
European cities and knocking out quick likenesses for 20 
euros a time, Fluharty has taken the genre and elevated it 
to an art form. An acrylic painting of two baseball stars 
made for the cover of Time magazine now resides in the 
collection of the National Portrait Gallery in Washington, 
while a recent portrait of Hillary Clinton won a gold medal 
from Spectrum – the Oscars of American fantasy art. 

The first step to creating a great caricature, says Thomas, 
is finding a subject that you are passionate about. “The 
next key is usually all about the drawing – nailing down the 
drawing and making sure it’s amazing before you even get 
to the painting. Drawing is everything. If it’s a weak drawing 
it doesn’t matter how well it’s painted, it’s still lame.”

Warming to the subject, he adds: “I also think great 
caricature or great art should move the viewer, provoking 
an emotional response. An example of this would be when 

Paul McCartney tweeted my Beatlemania image with the 
screaming fans – McCartney’s fans responded with either 
intense hatred for it or a massive love for it. Their two-sided 
response confirmed to me that it was a powerful image.”

Thomas Lively Fluharty Jr. has been honing his ability to 
create such powerful images since he was a child. Born in 
1962 in Santa Ana, California, he remembers spending 
hours marveling at a “rather impressionistic” painting that 
hung on the family’s living room when he was a child. His 
first forays into making art involved drawing the actors and 
celebrities in the family’s weekly TV guide. 

At school, Thomas pursued his interest in art, switching 
to a vocational college for 11th grade. It was here that his 
teacher introduced him to a host of artists who would  
prove influential on his chosen career path, including 
20th-century American illustrators Bernie Fuchs and 
Maxfield Parrish. “Parrish had a magical quality about  
his work,” recalls Thomas. “Everything was beautiful, from 
the lighting in the clouds, to the trees and the mountains. 
The beautiful colours really had an impact on me.”  

A degree at the Art Institute of Pittsburgh followed, after 
which time a job illustrating products for a local newspaper 
failed to materialise. Disappointed, his friend suggested  
he send his CV to two storyboard houses in New York, one 
of which – Gem Studios – promptly called him back and 
offered a week’s trial shift. “The main reason I got the job >

Artists & Illustrators 43

42 Thomas Fluharty.indd   43 01/10/2015   15:10



44 Artists & Illustrators

was because I could draw with markers. I trained 
extensively in markers all because an art director once told 
me that if I could use them my foot was in the door.”

The studios’ main clients were demanding ad agencies 
that required complex storyboards drawing at a moments 
notice. “The cool thing was that I got to train with Kenny 
Bald,” says Thomas of the veteran comic artist. Bald had 
worked for Marvel Comics during its heyday and also 
created the popular Dr Kildare and Dark Shadows strips, 
before becoming creative director of Gem Studios in 1981. 
“I showed him my drawings all the time. He taught me solid 
drawing fundamentals and storytelling.”

After 13 years, Thomas struck out on his own, beginning 
life as a jobbing illustrator. It wasn’t long before he landed 
the cover of Mad, the long-running American satirical 
magazine, and a New York Times commission for five 
caricatures of Jerry Lewis. Those two jobs kickstarted his 
fledgling freelance career, but despite continued 
successes, Thomas couldn’t escape the feeling that his 
practice was missing something. In 2002, he embarked on 
eight years of courses and training at both the National 
Academy School and the School of Visual Arts in New York.

“My main reason for wanting classical training was 
because I felt like I was lacking fundamentals and I wanted 
a stronger foundation than I had as an illustrator,” he says. 
“For me, it was really a matter of going back to the basics.  
I wanted to learn from somebody great that had been 
trained classically. If it worked for Rembrandt or 
Bouguereau, I wanted to know what they knew.

“The classical training helped me to see and paint form 
and think about what exactly I’m painting. I also started 
thinking more about my strokes and every move serving 
the whole of the painting, as opposed to just bashing 
through a painting without serious thought.”

In keeping with this more reflective attitude, Thomas also 
used the opportunity to acquaint himself with oil paints and 
all the attendant mediums and additives that come with 
them. The demands of illustration required the use of 
quicker drying acrylics, but he wanted to develop his own 
work in the new medium. “My favourites are Old Holland 
oils,” he reveals. “They’re expensive but excellent. I’m also 
painting with a Cremnitz White, which has lead in it. It’s very 
hard to get [because of the ban on lead-based paints] but 
has an awesome texture to it. It feels like cream cheese.”

In tandem with this in-depth exploration into classical, 
atelier-style training, Thomas also developed a series of 
children’s books with his wife Kristi. Writing and illustrating 
under the not-quite-a-pseudonym T Lively Fluharty, the 
couple began in 2009 with Fool Moon Rising, the story of  
a boastful moon. “Our main goal in writing the book was to 
teach the concept of humility to little kids, especially our 
five daughters,” says Thomas, a regular churchgoer. “It’s 
crucial to seek humility rather than boast in who we are.” 

To break down a text for illustration, Thomas begins by 
reading and re-reading it, before drawing a sequence of tiny 
thumbnails. “This phase helps me conceptualise ideas 
without committing to anything constraining. I then re-read 
the story, enlarge the sketches, and lay out the book to get 
a good feel to how the pages turn – it’s a first solid look at 
how text and imagery come together. This gives me a really 
good sense as to how the book feels with each page turn.

TALKING TECHNIQ UES

“THE KEY TO A GOOD CARICATURE IS

MAKE SURE IT IS AMAZING BEFORE YOU EVEN START PAINTING”  
NAILING DOWN THE DRAWING FIRST.

I then show a few people and get feedback from them. 
Feedback is extremely important.”  

Throughout his career, Thomas has absorbed the advice 
of his peers and influence of the great masters, 
channelling them with enthusiasm and imagination into 
whichever genre or challenge he is presented with. 

Nowhere is that more apparent than his Pop Culture 
series, an on-going collection of caricatured portraits  
in oils that the artist is developing on his own terms.  
From Bill Clinton and The Beatles, to Serena Williams and 
Steven Spielberg, he has chosen to create “larger than 
life” paintings of artistic and cultural heroes. “Basically, 
I’m helping people with their hero worship,” he jokes.

The painting of each icon begins with Google and a 
trawl through the countless images on the Internet. With 
such famous faces, Thomas tries to look for the less 
popular images that nevertheless capture the essence of 
the person in question. He then collates them and thinks 
about what it is exactly that he wants to achieve. “In my 
first sketch of Paul McCartney, I actually had him standing 
up to a microphone and then I came to a better conclusion 
in the sketch of him sitting at the piano. I also had to make 
sure the microphone I was using as a reference was 
correct, so I sought advice from a Beatle expert who 
happened to be a musician. Essentially what I want to do 
is create a moment that hasn’t been seen before, as 
opposed to just painting a photograph.” 

Thomas has a three-point creed that every icon drawing 
must meet: do I love it? Is it heroic? Has it been seen 
before? Provided each criteria is met, he will then transfer 
the successful drawing to a stained canvas via an Epson 
3880 projector. His Paul McCartney that graces this 
month’s cover was then developed using what Thomas 
calls the Dutch-Flemish approach. This involves three 
distinct stages: the underpainting (sculpting the forms 
tonally), the body colour (laying down pigment) and the 
adjustment phase (knocking back areas and adding thin 
glazes to control colour temperature). It gives the works an 
added depth, even if the artist finds it a little tedious.  
“I prefer the alla prima approach these days,” he says. “It 
feels much more fresh and exciting – and it’s also quicker.”

Despite a long and celebrated career in illustration so 
far, Thomas is on an eternal quest to keep his painting 
similarly fresh and pass on those ideals to others. “If I 
could give any advice to young artists or even seasoned 
artists it would be this: paint what you love. Paint what 
moves you. Study with great people. Seek critiques and be 
teachable. Also be patient. It takes thousands of bad 
drawings and paintings to defeat mediocrity. Press on and 
fight through your doubts. Know that every image you 
commit to is not always going to work or be awesome,  
but there will be those paintings or images that keep  
you returning to the wonder and gift of making art.”

paint around them with a light-grey wash. 
Next, place the bright colours and the 
mid-tones in a second layer, and fi nish by 
placing the strongest darks in a third layer. 
Creating this quick map fi rst can make it 
easier to focus on what to paint at which 
stage. If you build your fi nished painting in 
a similar way to the map, the structure will 
emerge and leave you to fi ll in the rest. 

Above all, remember that this is a painting 
of extremes. The key with night scenes is to 
limit the amount of highlights and make sure 
your mid-tones are pitched a little darker 
than you would for a daytime landscape.

I  was very honoured to be selected to represent England at the World Watermedia Exposition in Thailand last year. A tour of 
the country with my fellow painters resulted 
in plenty of new material for me – we did lots 
of plein air painting and I took photos with my 
smartphone. One of my favourite subjects 
was Bangkok’s Chinatown. My artist friend 
Michal Jasiewicz took better photographs 
and let me use one for this painting. 

A subject such as this can look complex, 
so the best way to approach it is to break it 
down and make a map. On a spare sheet of 
paper, begin by defi ning the white and 
pale-coloured areas – sketch them out and

 1 PLAN YOUR HIGHLIGHTS

The original photo depicted a complex scene 
but for my initial sketch, I reduced it to a few 
choice elements. The key components were 
the tuk-tuk and the large vertical banners. 
I drew lines to indicate the main lines and 
shapes. Next, I used masking fl uid to pick out 
the highlights, including the roof of the 
tuk-tuk, the street lamps, the car headlights 
and the shop signs. 

 3 PLOT THE FIGURES

Although I have reserved highlights in 
masking fl uid, I still left many fl ashes of white 
paper by painting around select areas such 
as the fi gures. I applied Neutral Tint wet-in-
wet to the street area with touches of 
Vermilion Red and Cadmium Orange. I also 
applied a very light grey to the background 
with a mix of Cobalt Blue and Burnt Sienna.   

 2 APPLY FIRST COLOURS

I started to apply the lighter colours fi rst, 
including mixes of Cadmium Lemon, 
Cadmium Orange and Vermilion Red for the 
banners. I used a light mix of Neutral Tint and 
Vermilion Red for the dark area in the top left 
corner and Naples Yellow with Cobalt Blue for 
the bright shop interior lighting. I applied 
more colours wet-in-wet, including Burnt 
Sienna at the top, and a Naples Yellow and 
Phthalo Green mix to the building. 

 4 BUILD TONAL VALUES

I built the tonal values further with more grey 
washes. Matching the exact colour of the 
scene was not crucial at this stage. I applied 
Neutral Tint and Vermilion Red to the 
buildings on the right and added Naples 
Yellow to this mix for the washes left of the 
banner. I added more of the light grey Cobalt 
Blue and Burnt Sienna mix to the street in 
the distance, which saved more highlights in 
addition to those I had masked. >

 7 WORK WET-IN-WET

I wetted the upper-middle area with clean 
water and then dropped in bands of colour 
wet-in-wet – Neutral Tint with Burnt Sienna 
for the darker banners, Cadmium Lemon with 
Cadmium Orange for the yellow banner and 
Naples Yellow with Phthalo Green for the 
green banner. Using a similar technique,  
I painted the hoarding on the far right with 
French Ultramarine, Quinacridone Magenta 
and Cadmium Orange.

 9 SCRAPE HIGHLIGHTS

I applied a stripe of Phthalo Green and 
Neutral Tint wet-in-wet to the area left of the 
green sign to suggest its reflection in the 
shiny building. I also brushed strong strokes 
of Neutral Tint over the upper-left building, 
working wet-on-dry and following the 
perspective lines of the picture. 

While this area was wet, I used my brush 
handle to scrape lines to suggest cables. 

 5 OUTLINE THE SIGNS

I built up to the mid-tones here, applying a 
darker Neutral Tint and Vermilion Red wash 
to the buildings on the right. I used various 
mixes of Vermilion Red, Neutral Tint and 
Cadmium Orange to outline the characters 
on the banners and the red sign.

Next, I applied clear water to the shop 
fronts on the left and dropped in French 
Ultramarine and Burnt Sienna wet-in-wet for 
soft shadows at the base and edges. 

 6 ADD DEPTH IN DISTANCE

I painted the smaller signs using the size 8 
pointed brush with French Ultramarine and 
Phthalo Green. I also applied a rich mix of 
Vermilion Red and Cadmium Orange to the 
sky area. I completed the sky by running a 
very strong Neutral Tint wash wet-in-wet into 
this area to darken it. I used this wash to

working the paint into the buildings on the 
right so they merged into the night sky.

 8 LAYER THE WASHES

While that wash was still wet, I added extra 
Quinacridone Magenta and Neutral Tint to 
the darkest parts in the upper left corner.  
I allowed this to dry and then worked 
wet-on-dry over this area to indicate all of the 
electrical infrastructure and cables. Building 
in layers like this adds interest to a painting.

 10 PAINT THE TUK-TUK 

I applied French Ultramarine wet-on-dry to 
the front of the main tuk-tuk. I added Neutral 
Tint to darken certain parts, avoiding the 
unmasked central light recess. I also applied 
Neutral Tint to the tuk-tuk’s shadow on the 
street and the wheels, leaving light accents 
on the wheel guards. I echoed the colour in a 
series of vertical strokes on the hoarding 
above the tuk-tuk.  

 13 FINISHING TOUCHES

I wet the distant street surface and applied 
Burnt Sienna and Neutral Tint strokes 
wet-in-wet between the vertical headlamp 
reflections. I then allowed this to dry and 
added more strokes of the same colours, 
working wet-on-dry. The texture of the rough 
paper allowed speckles of ‘light’ to remain.  
I finished by removing all the remaining 
masking fluid by rubbing it with clean fingers.  

 12 TIGHTEN THE dETAIl

I defined the cars and figures with Neutral 
Tint. For the figures lit up by the shop front,  
I used Cadmium Orange and then worked over 
them wet-in-dry with Neutral Tint. I scrubbed 
over the masked headlight highlights with a 
stiff, clean, wet brush. I removed the masking 
fluid and then immediately softened the 
edges of the highlights to create a glare.

 11 PICK OUT THE TRAFFIC 

I completed the tuk-tuk with Cobalt Blue and 
Burnt Sienna for the roof, and a little 
Vermilion Red for details. I turned my 
attention to the distant mass of tone at 
street level. I used Quinacridone Magenta to 
pick out signs and dropped in Neutral Tint, 
wet-in-wet. I picked out rough car shapes to 
give an overall suggestion of traffic.

KEEN TO START CREATING LESS REALISTIC IMAGES? KEVIN SCULLY  SHOWS 
YOU HOW TO TAKE A FIRST STEP TOWARDS A MORE PAINTERLY FINISH

There comes a time in an artist’s life when the fear of repetition and the desire to take one’s work in a slightly different direction becomes of paramount 
importance. And so I am forever striving to move away from 
a relatively literal style into that area of painting that sits 
somewhere just across the border from reality. 

Having no interest in purely abstract art, I strive to create 
a painting that is slightly enigmatic and leaves the viewer to 
fi ll in some of the more vague passages. The challenge, 
then, is to supply just enough information in a painting that 
allows for personal interpretation.

There are some images that are immediately suitable for 
such a composition, and From There to Here, my painting 
of Chesil Beach in Dorset, is one such image. The distant 
horizon is linked in dramatic fashion to the foreground by 
the strip of isolated beach. 

It became evident after a few preliminary, simple 
sketches that placing the horizon high up in the 
composition would create a suitably dramatic image. 

I worked on 3mm MDF (a good alternative to the rather 
mechanical surface of canvas painting boards), priming it 
fi rst with two coats of acrylic gesso and a thin wash of 
acrylic paint – a fairly neutral mixture of Burnt Umber with 
a touch of Ultramarine and Payne’s Grey. The local colours 
were blocked in with fairly dilute paint and I avoided 
blending them together. Grading the sky from dark blue 
at the top to a lighter blue at the horizon heightened the

gouache and using 

your sketches as a basis 
for oil paintings at a later 
stage. Working away 
from the subject allows 
you to better create your 
own interpretation of 
the scene.

2 Look back at your old paintings and 
pick one out that 

could be taken a stage 
further. Paint another 
version of it, but this time 
use a different colour 
scheme or leave out 
and obscure some of 
the detail. 

3 Look at magazines for inspiration. 
I sometimes come 

across a totally unrelated 
image that contains 
colours I wouldn’t maybe 
think of putting together. 

I also try turning 
images upside-down and 
using the arrangement 
of shapes to suggest 
unusual landscape or 
interior compositions. 

4 If a painting has drifted too far into 
realism, wipe out 

certain areas with a rag 
or piece of kitchen paper. 
This can often reveal an 
exciting, ghostly under-
painting that can be left 
as it is, or worked into 
with more colour. 

5 A bad photo with distortion, lens 
fl are or a lack of 

focus can often suggest 
surprising effects or 
colours. Take this a 
stage further by printing 
out when your printer is 
running out of ink in one 
or more of the colour 
cartridges. The distorted 
colours can provide new 
avenues to explore.

sense of aerial perspective, and similarly the sea was 
painted with a darker blue in the foreground. In the 
under-painting, the areas of land on the horizon and to 
the right of the image were suggested with simple strokes 
of complementary colours. 

At this stage, I veered away from the actual colours and 
replaced them with others of a higher key. Reality can be 
distorted by introducing patches of the same colour into 
unconnected areas of the painting. A small patch of red 
was detected in the distance, and this colour was 
introduced in random areas. To a certain degree, where 
these colours are placed is an intuitive process and 
occasionally they have to be removed because they either 
add nothing to the overall image or they just look wrong. 
Happy accidents occur, however, and these are left in place. 
As the painting began to take shape, patches of colour 
were blurred together with a swipe of a fi nger or extended 
either vertically or horizontally with the edge of a fi ngernail. 

I fi nd it rather diffi cult to deviate from a literal depiction 
when I’m painting in front of the subject and it seems a lot 
easier to achieve the desired result when I’m detached 
from it. As such, I will often begin a painting in situ and 
then complete it in the studio. The crucial stage in the 
process is to know when to stop; it’s all too easy to keep 
adding detail, but this should be avoided.

TIPS TO TRY
1. Make a colour chart to see the 
range of mixes achievable with 
your limited palette. It can serve as 
a reference guide and remind you 
how you achieved particular mixes.

2. Attend a local life class and 
challenge yourself to paint sketches 
in 15- or 30-minute sessions. 

Without the time to overthink your 
colour mixing, you will inevitably 
speed up and work more intuitively.

3. Apply a coloured ground to your 
support before painting. This will 
unify the whole composition, 
allowing you to work even more 
economically and avoiding the 
need to cover the entire surface.

paintings lack some kind of harmony, something that holds 
everything together. While Zorn didn’t invent the idea of the 
restricted palette and he is by no means the only artist to 
employ that method, I like to think he used it for much the 
same reasons as me. 

WHAT ARE THE BENEFITS?
There are many reasons to take on the challenge of using 
a limited palette, the fi rst one being simplicity. One can 
sometimes feel overwhelmed when confronted with a 
complex subject and myriad colourful shapes. Approaching 
a subject like this with a limited palette will instantly give 
you more control over your colour mixing, limiting your 
options and giving you less decisions to make, which in 
turn will help you to paint quicker. This is useful if you’re 
painting a subject from life and time is precious. 

With fewer colours, there’s less chance of over-
complicating the mix and muddying them. A more 
restrained palette will also help you to get to know your 
colours really well and stretch the possibilities of each one 
to their full capacity. And remember, if you’re painting with 
watercolours you can use the blank paper as your ‘white’ 
so you actually only need three colours!

Since the times of our Paleolithic ancestors, the idea of 
using a limited palette has been one of the painter’s most 
useful processes. Cave paintings such as those at Lascaux, 
France were made using only three pigments; yellow, red 
and black derived from iron-oxide deposits from the earth 
and carbon thought to be from fi re ashes. These were 
materials used out of necessity rather than choice that 
allowed man to depict the world in simple terms.

Throughout history, artists have used whatever was 
available to them at the time. Where Paleolithic man had 
only simple pigments, artist’s today have a plethora of hues 
and mediums to chose from with an almost unending 
choice at their disposal. Maybe that’s why the idea of going 
back to the limited palette and using colours not so distant 
from those of the cave paintings is so appealing.

WHAT IS A LIMITED PALETTE? 
There are many variations of the limited palette, there’s no 
one defi nitive combination of colours. Each artist has their 
own approach, having tried and tested favourite colours 
and methods. One such palette I have experimented with is 
that of the 19th-century Swedish artist Anders Zorn, best 
known for his portraits and domestic scenes. 

Zorn’s limited palette consisted of Yellow Ochre, 
Vermillion, Black and Titanium White – just four colours. 
If we look at Zorn’s Self-Portrait [pictured left], however, 
we see a fantastic range and richness of tones, and great 
subtlety in the colour temperature of the shadows. The four 
colours can be seen in pure form on his palette and they 
sing against the desaturated mixes that appear in the rest 
of the painting.

I have often stripped back my palette when I feel 
overwhelmed by pigment choices or perhaps feel that my

WHAT SHOULD I FOCUS UPON?
The best way to approach a limited palette is to think of the 
colours as equivalents for your subject colours. You may 
never get that exact shade of green that you require, but 
with careful mixing you’ll fi nd an equivalent value that will 
relate to the colours and tones that surround it.

Zorn’s colours were mostly warm in tone, which means 
they work really well with fl esh tones. You could try a 
self-portrait in the style of Zorn with a strong side light 
and experiment with natural light (which is cooler) or 
artifi cial light (which is warmer) to see how this affects your 
colours. Or you could try setting up a harmonious still life 
using only warm coloured objects, again using strong 
directional lighting to carve out the objects from 
their shadows.

Due to the colour limitations, the Zorn palette leans more 
towards working tonally, so the resulting painting will have a 
beautiful subtlety more akin to a gentle whisper as 
opposed to one that is shouting at you. 

HOW DO I MIX CERTAIN COLOURS?
When you are painting in colour, you need a red, a yellow 
and a blue or an equivalent for each. With the Zorn-style 
palette, you have Cadmium Red or Vermillion for your red 
and Yellow Ochre for your yellow. 

The interesting twist comes with the blue. Like many Old 
Masters using the four-colour palette, Zorn mixed a cool 
black and a cool white to create a light grey mix that would 
read as ‘blue’. There is, of course, no true blue pigment in 
that mix but the combination of two pigments with a cooler, 
blue-bias helps to suggest the absent colour and trick the 
eye into believing what it can see. 

You can encourage this further by juxtaposing it with 
contrasting colours. For example, if I want to make a 
painting with plenty of blue or black in it, working on a 
complementary warm, earthy reddish-brown ground will 
lift the dark tones and give them more life.

Four-colour portraits require subtle mixes and encourage 
you to look closely. Shadows can appear very dark and you 
may be tempted to use pure black, but if you look closely at 
your subject you may see warmth in the shadow areas, just 
as Zorn did in his Self-Portrait with Model. Try to paint 
these dark areas fi rst to establish the range for the rest 
of the painting. 

As you become more comfortable with the four-colour 
approach, you can alter one of the four colours and see 
how this affects your mixes. For instance, you might try 
substituting the Cadmium Red for a cooler Alizarin Crimson 
or the Ivory Black for a warmer Lamp Black and see what 
happens. Likewise, adding just one extra colour will greatly 
alter the scope of your palette. The addition of a French 
Ultramarine or a Cobalt Blue will completely change the 
range of possible colours, adding more vibrancy to the mix.

Above all, remember that the tones created with a 
restricted palette will be more subdued than if using a full 
palette of colours. Try to juxtapose complementary colours 
together. For instance, putting an olive green mix (Yellow 
Ochre with a touch of Ivory Black) next to a red will trick the 
eye into thinking the green is more vibrant than it really is.

TITANIUM WHITE
The most powerful and opaque of the whites  
is an excellent choice for direct painting.  
This is a ‘cold’ white so I rarely use it 
straight from the tube – I prefer to mix in a 
small amount of Yellow Ochre to warm it up. 

YELLOW OCHRE
This earth colour is an excellent base for flesh 
tones when warmed up with Cadmium Red. 
Try mixing it with Ivory Black to make a 
lovely olive colour, which could be your 
equivalent of green in a four-colour palette.

CADMIUM RED
The best affordable substitute for Zorn’s  
preferred Vermillion. Cadmium Red helps to 
warm up other colours when used in small 
quantities. It is particularly useful for ears, 
hands, the nose and other extremities.

IVORY BLACK
This cool black is essential for producing the 
darker values, as well as a series of cool 
greys when mixed with Titanium White, 
which can act as your blue equivalent in the 
four-colour system.

Perspective. Now there’s a word to send shivers down the spine of many painters. A few years ago at one of my workshops, one of the less experienced students 
asked: “Why does drawing have to be complicated so much 
by perspective?” 

This view is not uncommon and yet it couldn’t be further 
from the truth. Far from complicating the creation of an 
artwork, a knowledge of perspective and how it can be 
applied in a practical way can, in fact, make drawing much 
less difficult. A lack of understanding of perspective is the 
main reason why many drawings and paintings look wrong. 
It is also important to dispel the notion that perspective 
only applies to buildings. While it is far easier to identify on 
a geometric, man-made object such as a house or bridge, 
I’m afraid it applies to every real subject there is – even the 
emptiest landscape. To put it simply, perspective allows us 
to represent any three-dimensional subject on a two-
dimensional sheet of paper. 

Mathematical perspective is one of the ways we create 
the illusion that our flat sheet of paper has depth and in 
order to do this, we need to know where the eye level is on

our subject. Eye level is a horizontal plane directly in front 
of our eyes as we view a real subject. Take a perfectly flat 
sheet of stiff card and hold it up in front of your eyes, 
touching the top of your nose directly in front of your pupils. 
Adjust the far edge up and down until you can see neither 
the top nor bottom of the card. At that point, the blurry-
edged line you see is your eye level and it is the most 
important line to establish on any figurative drawing or 
painting. It should be the first line you make on a sheet of 
paper, simply because every other line relates to it in some 
way. Now if that plane could extend to infinity, it would 
appear to coincide with the horizon. If you can see the 
horizon line, that is your eye level. 

So why is eye level important? The basic rule of 
perspective states that receding horizontal lines appear to 
slope towards eye level and to this we can add that parallel 
horizontal lines, if continued, will appear to meet at a single 
point on eye level, a point known as a vanishing point. You 
will probably be familiar with one or two point perspective 
as it applies to buildings. Those one or two vanishing points 
allow you to draw every part of the building with absolute

accuracy, except perhaps where the building meets the 
ground as this line may not be a true horizontal. If a straight 
street has a row of buildings on each side and the rows are 
parallel then a single vanishing point will allow you to check 
the accuracy of almost every line you draw. Is that not 
easier than guessing the slope of every door or every brick? 

If you pay attention to your vanishing points you cannot 
help but draw accurately. With spheres and circles it is 
even easier. A sphere is always a sphere. It will never be 
distorted. Circles will flatten and become ellipses as they 
approach eye level. Mathematical perspective gives us a 
way of accurately showing how objects appear to become

smaller as they recede but just as important is how these 
objects appear to visually change with recession, 
something known as atmospheric perspective. As objects 
recede, the atmosphere makes them appear to be less 
hard edged, less detailed, less colourful and lacking in 
contrast. Colour will tend towards blue because of the 
scattering of light. Applying these atmospheric effects to 
your paintings, even if they are not very obvious, will 
dramatically improve the sense of depth. On a flat sheet  
of paper, the two trees will appear to be one unless the 
more distant tree is painted to take account of the 
atmospheric perspective. >

three-point perspective
Unsurprisingly, three-point perspective involves three 
vanishing points and it is commonly found in subjects 
viewed at steep angles, either from above or below.  
It is often referred to as the ‘ant’s eye view’, as it  
makes objects appear monumental in size.

In landscape painting, three-point perspective commonly 
occurs when you attempt to render very tall buildings 
viewed from street level or valleys from a high vantage 
point. In this particular example, working to the third 
vanishing point helps to exaggerate the scale of this  
tall office block.

two-point perspective
A two-point perspective refers to an image with two 
vanishing points, often located arbitrarily along the horizon 
line. It is used to depict buildings or other elements of a 
landscape from an angle, rather than face on (as in 
one-point perspective).

The photo above left is a good example of two-point 
perspective where two sides of every building are clearly 
visible. Although the buildings were quite complex in 
structure, every horizontal line can be continued to one  
of two vanishing points on the yellow horizon line.Top tip

one end at the

one-point perspective
An artwork is said to have one-point perspective when it 
contains a single vanishing point, often located on the 
horizon line. One-point perspective is commonly found in 
street scenes where we see only one side of a building. 

In the example on the left, all of the lines meet at the 
single white vanishing point marked in white. The horizon is 
clearly at eye level. Notice also that the heads of everybody 
on the promenade are also at eye level. If you are standing 
on a horizontal surface then the heads of every person on 
that surface will be at eye level. Slight variations of this 
indicate the natural variation in the heights of the people.

Curved bays
Natural bays can often be considered to be part of an 
ellipse – this avoids a common mistake of making the curve 
too regular. Note also that the beach is slightly sloped so 
the axis of the ellipses (the yellow line) is at an angle. 

As with the straight beach, natural features will probably 
not correlate precisely with mathematical perspective but  
it will be close enough to help greatly with the drawing. 
Always considerer Cézanne’s assertion that everything in 
nature can be reduced to cubes, cylinders and spheres. 
Perspective allows us to create these shapes from simple 
lines and circles.

sCaLe aNd dePTH
Remember that on any flat ‘surface’ such as the sea 
your eye level will cut any similar objects at the same 
point – no matter how far away they are. For example,  
if your eye level falls half way up the mast of a dinghy 
that is close to you, then it will also fall half way up the 
mast of every similar dinghy on the same plane, 
irrespective of whether they are closer or further away.

FLaT PLaNes
Two-point perspective can be useful for depicting a flat 
beach scene. If you imagine the sand and sea to be 
covered with imaginary tiles, this can help you to organise 
elements such as seaweed or waves so that they are 
correctly proportioned.

What is 
etching?
Etching is an intaglio (relief) 
printmaking process that 
involves drawing a design 
onto a waxed metal plate, 
which is dipped into acid to 
‘eat away’ at the bare metal. 
Ink is then applied to the 
exposed lines before the 
plate is pressed onto a sheet 
of paper, leaving an imprint 
of the original design.

Often dismissed as the favourite artist of mathematicians, school kids and 1960s hippies, Maurits Cornelis Escher has never quite been 
given his due by the art establishment. The Dutchman 
didn’t make a single oil painting throughout his 50-year 
career, so his ingenious brand of graphic art has all too 
often been consigned to the print rooms of the world’s 
biggest museums, rather than the main galleries. However, 
as The Amazing World of MC Escher, a first major UK 
retrospective of his work, makes the transition from the 
Scottish National Gallery of Modern Art to London’s Dulwich 
Picture Gallery, the time is ripe to explore the techniques of 
one of the 20th century’s most unique draughtsmen. 

While MC Escher – or ‘Mauk’ to his close friends – was 
best known for his clever, surreal and illusory prints, he

began his artistic career with quite modest aims. Born in 
the Dutch city of Leeuwarden in 1898, Escher studied at 
the School of Architecture and Decorative Arts in Haarlem. 

After graduating in 1922, he moved to Rome and spent 
the next decade or so making regular trips across mainland 
Europe and various Mediterranean islands. From Marseille 
and Malta to Cordoba and Corsica, he documented the 
landscapes in a series of woodcuts, drawings and 
lithographs in which he began to develop his life-long 
ambition to “evoke exclusively a sense of wonder  
in my viewers”.

For a young man raised in the lowlands of Holland, 
Escher found his own sense of wonder in the undulating 
landscape of the Mediterranean coast. A key feature of his 
early landscapes was a series of dramatic perspectives,

or a bird’s-eye view, peering down over clifftops to the 
distant seas below. 

While many of his prints measured less than 30cm in 
width, the young artist nevertheless induced vertigo in the 
viewer by exaggerating these viewpoints further. He 
experimented with including objects in the foreground –  
a trick that all landscape artists should try. In 1930’s 
Castrovalva, for example, the large foliage in the bottom-
left corner comes in stark contrast to the tiny village of 
Cocullo in the distant valley below. This lithograph was

based upon a visit that the artist made to the mountainous 
region east of Rome in the spring of 1929, but he 
nevertheless took liberties with the composition, as the 
angle of the hillside was steepened and key buildings were 
moved or edited out. In what appears to be a faithful and 
lovingly rendered print, Escher was cleverly manipulating 
nature in the pursuit of a more satisfactory image.

Another favourite tactic was framing a distant view 
through dark, silhouetted trees. This was a device often 
used in Japanese printmaking, an influence that Escher 
had absorbed through via his father, George, a senior

in Japan when he was younger and decorated the family 
home with various woodcuts and lacquerware he had 
brought back to the Netherlands with him. 

impossible staircases
One of the key features of many of MC Escher’s most iconic 
prints is the inclusion of staircases that double back on 
themselves or continue upwards (or downwards, depending 
on your disposition) to infinity. 

For many years, it was believed that these illusionary 
effects were simply born of Escher’s interests in 
perspective and space. However, when a curator from Het 
Paleis made a visit to the artist’s former secondary school 
in the Dutch city of Arnhem, they made a surprising 
discovery. The image on the right shows the building’s 
original staircase (photographed and reworked by Gerrit 
Schreurs to remove any modern architectural elements) 
and the similarities between that and many of Escher’s 
prints are remarkable. Look closely at the underside of the 
staircase in the top left of the photograph and it even 
appears to morph into a completely different viewpoint that 
would allow you to walk back down it.

Having described his schooldays as “Hell in Arnhem”, the 
building itself clearly made a lasting impression on Escher. 
As Micky Piller explains in the catalogue for The Amazing 
World of MC Escher, “crowds of pupils used the four 
stairways every day; the scene was always in motion. 
Whenever Escher joined the crowd, he could see this 
movement from above, from beneath and diagonally. Every 
perspective was different and dependent upon his position”.

Several of Escher’s prints from the 1940s and 1950s 
make direct visual quotations of that Arnhem staircase. 
Relativity mimics the same archways and staircases, while 
Up and Down places them into an Italian setting and twists 
the vanishing point back on itself.

While it would be hard to utilise these differing 
viewpoints and unexpected perspectives in your own work

tips to trY
Ideas InspIred by MC esCher’s 
prIntMakIng teChnIques

• With distant landscapes, consider adding a larger 
object in the foreground to add a sense of depth and 
scale. Add further interest by framing the view 
through trees or a window.
• In his later works, Escher distorted perspectives to 
create a disorienting effect on the viewer. Experiment 
with multiple viewpoints within a single picture plane 
to achieve similar effects. 
• Use a grid as the starting point for a decorative 
artwork. The restrictive framework will force you to 
find new and creative solutions to your composition.

without directly quoting from Escher, the lesson here is in 
the disorienting effects it can have on the viewer. If you are 
attempting a slightly surreal or visionary subject, adding 
these technical twists can enhance the experience.

impossible staircases
The tessellated drawings and prints of MC Escher marked 
the artist’s attempts at imposing a sense of order and 
structure on the natural world. Sketches that he made of 
the Moorish tiles of the Alhambra palace in Spain during 
two visits in 1922 and 1936 are often credited with 
inspiring his exploration of tessellation, yet the interest was 
clearly instilled in him at an early age and exploring during 
his study of the decorative arts at Haarlem.

For a rigorous draughtsman, tiling provided a framework 
within which he could allow his imagination to take flight. 
As Escher himself wrote in 1947, “it affords the artist 
infinite possibilities yet also confines him to the limitations 

imposed by the rules of play”. In 1924, George Polya 
established that there were just 17 different “plane 
symmetry groups” or tiling configurations, yet Escher used 
them in countless inventive ways. 1943’s Reptiles dips in 
and out of reality, creating a sort of perpetual motion for 
the viewer’s eyes as we follow the animals in both two and 
three dimensions. 

Again, a direct visual quote of such ideas will always bear 
the hallmarks of Escher. However, as any illustrator will tell 
you, setting yourself a brief or parameters in which to work 
can inspire new and varied avenues of creativity. While there 
will never be another MC Escher, there is much to learn 
from his attitude towards creativity and insistence on good 
draughtsmanship that will inspire for generations to come.
The Amazing World of MC Escher runs from 14 October to  
17 January 2016 at the Dulwich Picture Gallery, London SE21.

Most of my still life paintings feature a shiny object of some sort. While this is partly just 
the result of a child-like fascination 
with reflective surfaces, they also 
provide a tonal challenge and reflect 
adjacent colours, which helps to unify 
a composition.

I’ve painted this particular coffee 
pot a number of times. Repeatedly 
painting the same complicated 
subjects is a good way to practice.  
The trick with a reflective surface is to 
treat it like any other object: only paint 

the tones and colours that you 
actually see. Don’t think of it as ‘shiny’ 
and don’t exaggerate the contrasts 
– for example, don’t paint a light tone 
as white unless it really is white. 

Always be prepared to change a 
painting’s composition as it 
progresses. I didn’t make any major 
changes to this painting but I have 
several tricks to help keep my options 
open. I avoid establishing hard or soft 
edges until later on, and I work on a 
larger surface than necessary so I can 
expand one or more sides of the

image if required. I also like to begin 
with acrylics and then work over the 
top in oils. Acrylic dries quickly for a 
base coat, whereas oils offer a richer 
colour and don’t dry darker, so I can 
be sure my final layer is accurate. 

Should you wish to try this, use a 
similar palette of oils to the acrylics, 
but I recommend changing the 
Titanium White acrylic for a Zinc White 
oils for a better mix and also bringing 
in Cobalt Blue instead of Prussian 
Blue, which I find overpoweringly dark 
in oil mixes.

1 I settled on this grouping after spending some time positioning the 
three objects and viewing them from 
various eye levels. Starting with the 
acrylics for speed of drying, I coloured 
my paper with a wash of Burnt Umber 
acrylic before drawing the outlines in 
Alizarin Crimson with a round brush.

2 All of my drawing is done with obsessive measuring – I always 
make as many measurement marks 
as I feel necessary to create an 
accurate drawing. I kept an eye on the 
grouping and altered the position of 
marks on the paper by a millimetre or 
so here and there. When I was happy 
with the drawing, I used dilute Alizarin 
Crimson to add a little tone to the line 
drawing and give it a 3D effect.

3 I established the darkest and the lightest tonal areas here. I wasn’t 
happy with the tones on top of the 
coffee pot so I moved the light source 
slightly to get a simpler look. 

This is also the stage at which I 
start using my full palette: the warm 
primaries (Cadmium Yellow, Cadmium 
Red and French Ultramarine) for areas 
of direct light, and the cool primaries 
(Lemon Yellow, Alizarin Crimson and 
Prussian Blue) for areas in shadow. 
This colour palette never varies, no 
matter what subject I’m painting.

4 My light source was quite close to the set-up and so the shadow 
contrasts were very defined. As such, 
the shadows are an important part of 
this composition and I wanted to 
establish them here. I used the 10mm 
flat brush for the larger planes of 
colour and my trimmed round brush 
for the details and lines. I tried to keep 
an even level of finish over the whole 
picture plane from here on in. 

5 I switched the acrylics for oils at this stage. Oils make the tones 
richer and also make it possible to put 
down a colour in the knowledge that it 
won’t dry to a darker tone. I paint oils 
in the way I was taught at college: mix 
the paint to the consistency of cream, 
and just dab it on. Keep dabbing, 
don’t be tempted to ‘fill in’ larger areas 
– filbert brushes are useful for this.

6 I like to finish a picture without feeling that I’ve painted the life 
out of it. I tried to lose most of the 
original Alizarin Crimson drawing, and 
there are details that I want to get 
right, including the coffee pot’s hinge, 

the stalk on the peach and the 
tones on the sides of the jug.

Finish by asking yourself 
whether you’ve captured the 
qualities that first attracted you 
to paint the set up. In this demo 
painting, these qualities were mostly 
to do with the tonal values: were the 
shadows varied enough? Did the 
reflection of the peach in the coffee 
pot look right? Did the inside of the 
jug recede convincingly? When I could 
answer yes to all three, the painting 
was finished.

Continuing his series on the building bloCks of painting, Ray Balkwill 
looks at how vivid Colour and texture Can Create an eye-CatChing image

no matter what your level of painting, there are times when it’s necessary to step outside 
of the ‘comfort zone’ and try 
something completely new. 

Experimenting with different media 
or new painting techniques not only 
widens one’s creative horizons, but 
also prevents your work from 
becoming repetitive. Pushing the 
boundaries can bring with it some 
very surprising results. This was 
certainly the case for me with this 
studio painting, Silver Sea, Hope Cove. 
Normally my preference is to paint en 
plein air and endeavour to capture the 
mood and spirit of the landscape, 
whereas here I was more concerned 
with how vibrant colour and texture 
function as an element of composition. 

INTERPRETING LIFE
Normally when working in the studio I 
prefer to work from sketches, as I find 
these bring back the emotions of the 
place more readily than photos. 
However, in this instance, my 
reference image was a rather 
colourless photo taken from a high 
vantage point (see top right). 

This muted image proved an 
advantage in itself, as it not only 
helped me identify the tonal values 
more easily, but also allowed me to 
interpret the colours more freely. For 
maximum impact, I chose a limited 
palette of complementary colours in 
both acrylics and oils. I felt this would 
give me both the rich colours and the 
multi-layered textures that I wanted. 

TEXTURE ADDS DRAMA
Acrylic paints are extremely versatile 
and can offer possibilities for creating 
various textures. You can combine 
them with thickeners (such as a gel 
medium or modelling paste) and 
greatly vary the method of application 
(thin and dilute like watercolour or 
thick and impasto with a palette knife)

The surface of your support has a 

great bearing on which medium you 
should use and the effects that you 
are able to achieve with it – here I 
chose a mountboard primed with an 
equal-parts mix of gesso and texture 
paste. While it was still wet, I pressed 
materials such as clingfilm and fabric 
into the paint to create a textured 
surface. To create foreground interest, 
I glued grasses to the support with 
PVA glue and then applied a further 
coat of gesso on top. 

The great advantage of acrylics  
is that they are quick drying, so they 
are ideal as an under-painting for oils. 
It is important to remember that they 
should never be used over oil paint. 

VIVID COLOURS
Although acrylics may lack something 
of the depth and richness of oil paint, 
they make up for it with the wider 
variety of exciting colours at our 
disposal. In this painting, for example, 
I used a few metallic colours, including 
Gold, Bronze and Copper, mainly on 
the foreground area and the grasses, 
in order to help create depth. When 
these were dry I applied Cerulean 
Blue, Ultramarine, Burnt Umber and 
Titanium White oils. My intention was 
to be bold, using robust and painterly 
brushstrokes. 

Although I was pleased with the 
colourful and lively interpretation, 
after a few months I felt that the 
technique was beginning to take over 
from what I really wanted to say in 
each painting. 

Despite this, I found stepping out of 
my comfort zone was a very worthwhile 
experience. Silver Sea, Hope Cove 
won a prize in the South West 
Academy of Fine and Applied Arts’s 
inaugural open exhibition – proof, if 
needed, that painting should indeed 
be about exploring all possibilities. 
This, after all, is fundamental to the 
creative process and ultimately how 
all our new ideas are born.

What’s the best way to gather reference material?
I spent a lot of time doing fieldwork to get to know a 
subject. I’ve also got a feeder outside my studio so 
goldfinches come back and forth all the time. It makes it 
easier when you’re watching them. Most of them can look 
quite similar from a distance but you have to look at the 
patterns in the plumage to make them distinctive. 

Is it better to work from photographs?
I never work from photographs, but I do work from film 
sometimes. When I went to Africa, I took a lot of video 
footage that I used afterwards. Video helps capture 
movement and behaviour – it’s as if you’re watching the 
birds again. You can keep drawing from a moving image 
and it’s nice documentation of your experience as well. 

What palette of colours would you recommend?
When I’m out working, I try to pick colours I have observed 
from nature. A typical palette might include Magenta, 
Cadmium Red, Cadmium Yellow, Raw Sienna, Ultramarine, 
Viridian, Terre Verte, Titanium White and Burnt Sienna. 
People will often add pure black to create shadows but all 
that leaves you with is muddy colours. I use a combination 
of dark blues, greens or browns for my shadows. 

What brushes should I use?
I use ProArte Sterling Acrylix Series 201 brushes in all 
shapes and sizes, and I also use household decorating 
brushes from the local hardware store. I once spent £150 
on a really wide artists’ brush but you can get a similar 
equivalent for £14 in B&Q. The bristles are synthetic and 
soft. I use quite thin oil paint so the bristle brushes are 
good for creating gentle, sweeping marks to give your bird 
paintings a sense of energy.

Any good tips for capturing movement?
Making gestural marks from the elbow rather than the wrist 
helps suggest movement, but don’t rush your brushstrokes 
for the sake of it. I can work quickly and instinctively now 
because of practice, but start at a more sensible pace.  
The longer you have to decide what the viewer should and 
shouldn’t see, the better your bird will be.

Which is the best bird to paint?
The one I enjoy painting the most is the 
sparrow. They may seem like drab little birds 
but they’re quite active and not drab at all 
when you really look at their patterns, shape 
and feathers. I get the most value out of local 
birds because I’ve been watching and learning 
from them the most.

for example, is a stunning 
feature so I would rather 
focus on that rather than 
paint each feather on its 
wing, as it suggests more  
of its character. Look at the 
patterns and shapes within 
the bird, and think of the 
colours and tones. Accept 
that some of the stuff you 
leave out will be as important 
as the stuff you leave in. 

What if I make a mistake – should I start again?
Occasionally, you may get scared that you’re going to ‘kill’ 
your painting or go too far. If that happens, simply slow 
down, keep looking at the subject and the solution will 
often appear. I’ll usually finish a painting in a day but I find 
taking a break is good because you can come back, lay one 
more mark on it and suddenly it’s finished. 

Does it help to make preparatory sketches?
I sometimes draw out a faint oil outline on the canvas  
with a really small brush or charcoal, but often I just dive 
straight in. With Goldfinch on Thistle, I used charcoal to 
suggest the spikiness of the thistle in contrast to the 
softness of the bird. 

How can I keep proportions accurate when drawing 
multiple birds in a single painting?
If you’re going to paint more than one bird in a single 
composition, I find it helps to give more thought to your 
composition. I don’t do much in the way of preparatory 
sketching but I find that cutting out equal-sized pieces of 
paper and placing them where the birds should be in the 
composition helps. 

Does it help to study the anatomy of birds?
People always say it’s important to understand anatomy 
but, for me, observing and getting to know the shape and 
the movement of a bird is a much more useful exercise. 
Over the years, I’ve learned about the anatomy of a bird  
as a by-product of my observations but I don’t rely on it.

How much of the background, if any, should I paint?
It depends what you want to portray. The difficulty is getting 
the bird to feel like it’s a part of the landscape. Try to 
ensure the tonal values of the bird and the background are 
similar. Also remember that feathers are often a little bit 
reflective, so a bird in the hand might look white, while the 
same bird on a branch might look brown or green because 
of the reflected colours of the surrounding foliage.

82 Artists & Illustrators

My favourite artistic period
The Arts and Crafts movement (1). I grew up in 
north Oxford so I’ve got a complex love of Victorian 
architecture and suburban life. Although I think he 
was madly impractical, I love the eccentricity of 
William Morris and his passion for sewing.

My favourite reference book
The Concise British Flora in Colour by W. Keble 
Martin (2). My grandmother gave me an edition of it 
as a child and it’s got beautiful, classical illustrations. 

My essential art product
I use a lot of gouache (3). It’s a good medium for me 
because I can mix it as a ceramic underglaze and try 
out new sponges of colour on cartridge paper. 

My favourite art shop
Picturecraft of Holt in Norfolk. It’s where my 
husband, my mother-in-law, my father-in-law and  
I all shop. We scrap over the discount box, but my 
mother-in-law usually wins.

My favourite artist
Either John Sell Cotman (4) or Jean-Baptiste-
Camille Corot. They made dark days thrilling. I found 
myself choosing similarly dismal landscapes while 
selecting artworks for the ING Discerning Eye. 

My place for inspiration
Factories. I love understanding a making process 
and I adore the idea of people cooperating with one 
another to make something. When I started working 
with glass, for example, I visited a glassblower. 

My creative getaway
Paris (5). It’s a very aesthetically satisfying place –
you know the experience of sitting in a café with a 
good coffee is going to be just right. 

My last favourite exhibition
The Piero Fornasetti retrospective, La Folie Pratique, 
at Les Arts Decoratifs in Paris this summer was 
marvellous. He was an innovative and 
groundbreaking designer. 
Emma is one of six selectors for the ING Discerning Eye 
2015 exhibition, which runs from 12-22 November at 
Mall Galleries, London SW1. www.discerningeye.org
