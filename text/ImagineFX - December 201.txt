For some, ‘indie comics’ is anything that 
doesn’t feature supes flying around in their 
underpants. That’s simplifying things a tad. 
What links artists like Tim Gibson, Matt 
Taylor and Michael Dialynas (who all speak 
out in our feature Does Drawing Comics Pay 
on page 20) is they’re in charge, and not 
bothered by ambitious accountants. Their 
titles may be self-published or have minimal 
distribution, but they’re as original, weird 

and wonderful as their creators (want them to be).
Take our cover star, Tank Girl: Jamie Hewlett and Alan Martin’s 

anarcho-punk, eternally shooting around the post-apocalypse with 
her mutant kangaroo lover. Not your typical comic female lead, but 
as cover artist Brett Parson tells us on page 56, that’s the whole 
appeal. She was different when she burst on to the indie scene in 
the 80s and, tellingly, she still seems different in Brett’s 21st Century 
Tank Girl series today.

For me it’s great to finally feature Fiona Staples’ art, over on page 
42, and cool to see past Batman IFX cover artist Ken Lashley reveal 
his looser side on page 50. Then there’s Jean-Sebastian Monge’s 
caricature Hellboy! I’ve long loved his fantasy fine art, and when he 
suggested aiming a stylus at The Red One, it was a no-brainer... And 
just in case you’ve had enough comic art, and desperately want to 
paint a drunk medieval ferret party hard – fear not! The awesome 
Omar Rayyan will sort you out on page 106!

Location: US
Web: www.kirbiillustrations.com
emaiL: kirbi.illustrations@gmail.com
meDia: Photoshop

Since graduating art 
school, Kirbi has focused 
on producing Young Adult 
book covers. “Many people 
describe my work as 

nostalgic or dreamlike,” she reveals.  
“By combining textures and art styles  
of old and new I hope to create a 
timeless aesthetic.” 

Her inspirations are constantly 
evolving but she’s always admired 1960s 
lifestyle illustrators like Eric Earnshaw, 
Jack Potter and Coby Whitmore for 
their bold colours and shapes. “I insist 
on creating my own textures that I scan 
and integrate into my paintings, which 
means each piece has time on a real 
easel. Even though my work is stylised, 
it’s informed by reality. Building small 
dioramas and photographing models  
for reference are critical parts of  
my process.”

1Five WanDs“A tarot card based on Alice in Wonderland’s queen’s 
croquet game. The stylised, ribbon-like 
hair in this image was inspired by the art 
of JC Leyendecker.”

2Fairy taLe “This book takes place in a fairy world meets New York City. 
I’m currently working on the third book 
for this series by Shanna Swendson, 
which features the bulldog again who  
I adore painting!”

Jon Schindehette, founder of 
The ArtOrder, likes Kirbi’s style 

“Kirbi uses visual 
symbols, textures and 
minimal colour palettes  
to create visually rich and 

interesting images. The mixture 
of rendered and unrendered 
spaces adds a fresh feel and 
helps focus the eye.”

meDia: Photoshop

Priscilla grew up immersed 
in fantasy and science 
fiction, rarely seeing the 
sun and mostly playing in 
worlds of the imagination. 

She started drawing properly around 
the age of 12, when she discovered role-
playing and felt the urgent need to 
visualise her characters. 

Almost 20 years later, not much has 
changed, though she rarely plays these 
days. “I prefer depicting characters 
doing things or looking cool. But the 
most relaxing thing for me to do is to 
paint female portraits – a tendency  
I jokingly call my ‘pretty women staring 
off into space’ theme!”

1the aviatrix “Done for SmART School with Dan Dos Santos, the 
prompt being ‘the girl/boy with the 
golden wings.’ I chose to do something  
that I hadn’t tried before and went a 
little dieselpunk.”

2noW cracKs a nobLe heart  “A rerendering of an old, old sketch 
of old, old characters dating from 
middle school. I kept coming back to it 
over the years, but my skills weren’t up 
to par to finish it until more recently.”

3through a bLaDe DarKLy “Yet another SmART School piece, this 
one under the tutelage of Donato 
Giancola; the only guideline was 
‘reflection.’ I ended up doing a new 
rendition of an old role-playing 
character in a couple of her incarnations. 
No, it’s not Legend of the Five Rings.”

4in the DarKness binD him “Done for SmART School under Dan Dos 
Santos; the prompt was ‘the friendship 
between a girl and a vampire.’ I didn’t 
do friendship so much!”

IMaGINeFX crIt
“Priscilla’s aerial 
explorer artwork 
makes me want to 

strap on a pair of wings 
and jump around in the 
garden, in the hope of 
getting airborne. The 
warm evening sunlight 
adds to the atmosphere 
and feeling of freedom.”

MeDia: Photoshop

Reiko is a concept artist 
and illustrator based in 
Boston. Originally born in 
Japan, it has been 18 years 
since she moved to the US.

“I’ve always been interested in drawing 
people and animals even when I was a 
kid,” she says. 

Her love of drawing led her to enter 
the Rhode Island School of Design, and 
eventually to become a concept artist 
and character designer for video games. 
“For my personal work I focus on 
depicting female figures as surreal 
metaphors for emotions. Music and 
stories help me become inspired, but I 
almost always find a subject to paint 
deep inside my heart.”

1Love YouR neighboR “This was my unofficial contribution to Kristina 
Carroll’s Month of Love project. I also 
worked on it during Scott Fischer’s 
class. The dynamic movement in this 
scene came from his art direction.”

2June “I did this because I realised that I almost never painted a 
character looking directly at the camera. 
I still covered her eyes with her hair  
and textures, but this is a statement  
and a turning point in the series; I’ve 
conquered my trauma and acknowledge 
my strengths.”

IMAGINEFX CRIT
“Reiko’s painting 
skills are evident, 
but it’s also clear 

that she can follow art 
direction to enhance an 
already great concept, as 
shown in her Love Your 
Neighbor artwork. The 
swooshing houses add to 
the storytelling.”

Cai’s formal education in 
architecture eventually 
developed into a career in 
art and illustration, as his 
interest for creating 

imaginative worlds grew.
“I’m inspired by great stories, both 

epic narratives of heroes and monsters, 
and tales from my father of life as a 
young boy,” he says. “I’m always 
searching for the adventure in the 
mundane, spinning it into a visual 
narrative that might take the viewer 
through a journey of the mind’s eye.” 

Cai reveals that he loves telling 
stories through the stroke of his brush, 
and is looking forward to where this 
passion will take him.

1PoRtRait StuDY “I wanted to focus on a tight painting, experimenting 
with different brushes, digital painting 
techniques and edges. I also wanted to 
see how well I could portray mood and 
atmosphere, with that particular lighting 
setup and all the subtle colour changes 
in the flesh tones that came with it.”

2hoPe WaLkS “This image was produced as part of a personal 
project creating visual adaptations of 
certain scenes in The Night Angel 
Trilogy series of novels by Brent Weeks. 
It’s one of my favourite books.”

3aLMoSt theRe “Painted during the long hiatus between seasons two 
and three of Nickelodeon’s TMNT 
animated show. I wanted this image to 
tell a story about the brotherly 
relationship between the turtles during 
this trying period of their adventures.”

IMC 2012. The prompt I followed was the 
tale of Tristan and Isolde. One of the

Here, Isolde discovers Tristan on the

Wendy received no formal 
art training, but instead 
learnt from books, friends 
and mentors. Her art 
education was in fashion 

and graphic design, but in 2005 she 
decided to pursue illustration full-time 
and has never looked back. 

“I think my work can be boiled down 
to these three words: myth, magic and 
Mucha. I call my art mixed-media, since  
I switch back and forth between 
traditional and digital mediums, needing 
both to complete a painting.”

“Kim’s grasp of 
lighting is strong – 
and award-winning, 

in the case of her Healing 
Light artwork. But it’s also 
the small touches that 
enhance her paintings, 
such as the dragon rider’s 
braided hair that mirrors 
that of the dragon’s tail.”

mEDia: Photoshop

Freelance illustrator Kim 
graduated her Illustration 
degree from Sheridan 
College with a portfolio full 
of linear, editorial 

illustration, but quickly realised she 
would rather do realistic work featuring 
elves. Based out of Kingston, Ontario,  
the artist works mostly in the gaming 
industry for clients such as Paizo, AEG, 
and Fantasy Flight.  

“I love luminous, glowing lighting,” 
says Kim, “and painting narrative  
images that make people want to 
question the scene and fill in the  
blanks with their own story.”

1SPEciaL DELivEry “This was painted for Illustration Master Class 
2014, with the theme being ‘dragon 
rider’. I wanted to show a dragon being 
used as a courier of some sort, which of 
course leads to the question: what kind 
of city would need flying mail delivery 
the most?”

2PaLaDin “A paladin after an apocalypse. This was a two-year-old 
painting based on a four-year-old 
painting, recently revised because other 
people seemed to like it and so did I.”

3HEaLing LigHt “A job fell through after I’d already shot it, and I loved 
the photo’s lighting so much that I built 
a new piece around it. This piece won a 
Juror’s Choice award at Gen Con 2015.”

Does 
drawing 
comics 
pay?
Artists speak Garrick 
Webster asks indie comic 
artists about the industry 
and whether they’re able 
to earn a decent crust…

Illustrator Matt Taylor has been drawing 
Wolf, a fantasy/crime noir comic series 
published by Image.

With the buzz that surrounds superhero 

movies continuing unabated, it seems  

on the surface that there’s never been  

a better time to draw comics.

Let’s crunch some numbers. Christopher 

Nolan’s Batman trilogy brought in nearly  

$1.2 billion for Warner Brothers, owner of  

DC Comics. The 2012 Avengers film earned 

$623 million and in May 2015 Avengers: Age 

of Ultron came out with a tale of $191 million 

in its first week.

So what’s it like to be working 
for Boom?
They are very laid-back and easy-
going. The Woods is a project that 
will run for 36 issues so that’s nine 
trade paperbacks. I have a page rate 
and partnership cut of whatever is 
made. They have a pretty good deal.

What’s your view on the way  
the comic industry works?
The industry is at a high right  
now with creator-owned books 
booming compared to a few years 
back. But it’s a weird place for artists 
compared to the 90s, when we had 
major selling power and people 
would say, “Have you seen the new 
issue of X-Men? Jim Lee’s art is 
fricking awesome!” Then buy  
10 copies and put them in a safe.

What’s changed?
Things have shifted to the other 
extreme, where writers are held  
as the sole creators of comics and 
the artists are interchangeable. It’s 
odd when you think that we work 
in a visual medium and most 
artists work all day pencilling and 
inking one page.

What would you change?
Artists should have higher page-
rates, even if it’s an advance of 
royalties. Because of the time it 
takes to make each panel 
communicate to the reader, design 
the characters, build the world the 
story takes place in and act out 
every emotion on the page. Comic 
artists have the role of a whole film 
crew and should be treated as such.

What have you got coming up?
In December I’ll have my 
childhood dream come true when 
the first issue of Teenage Mutant 
Ninja Turtles I’m drawing comes 
out from IDW. I’m psyched!

company then he might make a fortune 

from it… one day.

The creator-owned indie model seems  

to be emerging as a favourite among artists 

– witness the success of Saga, drawn by 

Fiona Staples for instance (see page 42). 

The downside is that you can end up waiting 

three or four months for your royalties  

to come through.

Like Matt, New Zealander Tim Gibson 

became a comic artist out of 

sheer love for the genre. He 

was a 3D and concept artist at 

Weta, then became a 

freelance illustrator, but

up 20 per cent compared to May 2014.  

But still, these numbers are dwarfed by  

the film revenues.

What about the artists – are they seeing 

much trickledown of funds from these  

huge films? Not really. A survey on the site 

SKTCHD.com in mid-June showed that 

nearly half of comic artists who responded 

were earning less than $12,000 a year from 

comics, and that 28 per cent are on less than 

$100 per page. That’s borderline poverty.

“I’m new to the industry, but it does feel 

like there’s a lot of work for not a huge return 

in comics,” says Matt Taylor, who draws 

Wolf, published by Image. “A common 

recurring phrase I’ve heard is that you do  

it ‘for the love of comics’. Which may be true, 

but at the end of the day you still have to  

put food on the table.” 

The dream of royalTies
Like many other artists, England-based Matt 

takes commissions outside of comics to 

bolster his income. One half-page illustration 

for The New Yorker pays as well as 24 comic 

pages. Because Wolf is published by Image, 

which allows artists and writers to own their 

work, Taylor will earn royalties from the

always wanted to do comics. A grant in 

his home country enabled him to take a year  

off to produce Moth City. Luckily for Tim,  

it was snapped up by the subscription-

based web comic publisher Thrillbent, and 

by comiXology.

 

The web comic rouTe
As a publisher of a web comic, you have 

total control of your creation, but you also 

take all the risk of getting it out there, and 

making it happen takes a huge effort.  

“You might control your own destiny  

a bit more than an artist waiting to be 

commissioned or assigned to a comic,” says 

Tim. “But you also can’t succeed without  

all the associated tasks of running  

a web-business: regular blogging, site 

management, social media outreach and 

store management.” 

He adds: “There’s no guarantee that  

you’ll ever see any money from them, and 

building a site and audience that will allow 

eventual income is a dark art of its own.” 

And like Matt, Tim finds that a comic page 

earns him between 10 and 20 per cent of 

what he would normally receive from an 

illustration commission.

Dennis Calero is an artist who’s seen 

comics go from page to screen. He helped 

Platinum Studios to present its property 

Cowboys & Aliens to the film 

companies, and saw the fallout 

when the management and 

creators wrangled over the 

royalties. Today he writes and 

draws The Suit, which he owns and which 

appears in Dark Horse Presents.

“Publishers are reaching out to foreign 

markets in order to save a buck,” Dennis 

says. “Now, there are some incredible 

European, South American and Asian artists 

who are kicking a lot of ass. But there are a 

plethora of mediocre illustrators who just 

aren’t cutting the mustard and are clearly 

only getting work because they’re charging 

30 cents on the dollar.”

Artists today feel undervalued compared 

to writers. A writer on a comic is paid 

roughly the same amount as the artist, even 

though drawing it takes a lot longer than

writing it. A writer can appear in five or six 

titles a month; an artist only features in one, 

or maybe two if they’re working all hours. 

Yet the writer may walk away with many 

times what the artist has earned. 

Disney has owned Marvel Comics for the 

past five years, and some fear comic artists 

could soon be like animators: faceless 

workstation fodder, toiling away, low paid 

and unknown to the audience.

human resources
 “I hope eventually the idea that characters 

are all that matter in this genre will fall by the 

wayside and publishers will realise it’s the 

people that make these funny books that 

count and who are the backbone of any 

creative company. A resource to be grown 

and nurtured, not exploited,” says Dennis.”

With all the reboots we’ve seen from 

Marvel and DC, and with indie comics 

thriving one minute and diving the next, it’s 

hard to tell whether comic industry bosses 

really know what’s going on. Online and 

print publishing models continue to shift. Yet 

huge amounts of money are coming in from 

superhero films at the moment. Hopefully 

more of it will be wisely invested – in the 

comic artists who give life to the 

superheroes in the first place. 

Tim Gibson took a  
year out of his usual 

freelancing to  
create Moth City, the 

online comic.

Dennis Calero helped Marvel reinvent the 
X-Men as a group of sociopaths hunted by 

detectives, in X-Men Noir: Mark of Cain.

Thought Bubble was established in 2007 

as a one-day UK event – a non-profit 

organisation dedicated to promoting 

comics, graphic novels and animation. Its 

humble beginnings are long behind it, 

because the convention is now a week-

long tribute to the medium. 

“We try to make each Thought Bubble 

bigger and better than the last, and we’re 

constantly striving to bring comics to a 

wider audience,” says assistant director 

Clark Burscough. He says that every year 

the event attracts more amazing creators 

that even the team weren’t 

aware of. “It’s rewarding seeing 

so many new faces, and we 

get to meet people from all 

over the world,” he reveals. “It’s 

a great way of keeping abreast of the 

developments within the medium.”

This year Clark’s particularly excited to 

welcome Joan Cornellà to the festival, 

whose dark, humourous cartoons you may 

have seen shared on Facebook; and 

Montreal-based publisher Drawn and 

Quarterly. “We’re also really excited to be 

welcoming Rick Remender to Thought 

Bubble this year. His Deadly Class and Black 

Science series are two of the best monthly 

comics on the stands at the moment, and 

are well worth picking up the collections if 

you haven’t read them already,” says Clark.

As well as many major comic creators to 

meet and greet, and some talented indie 

folks, Thought Bubble is home to the British 

Comic Awards, founded by Adam Cadwell. 

“We’re always thinking of new ways to keep 

the Thought Bubble vibe going all year 

round,” Clark says. And if you can’t make the 

UK’s biggest comic event, you can still pick 

up a little of their bubbly vibe: “Every year 

we publish a charity anthology, which is 

distributed worldwide thanks to Image 

Comics.” This year’s anthology will be on 

sale 4 November in all good comic shops.

Thought Bubble is on from 9 to 15 

November in Leeds, England, and you can 

find out more about the convention and buy 

tickets at www.thoughtbubblefestival.com.

year’s Thought Bubble. This image

Divine creators Kate 
Brown and Kieron 
Gillen will both be at 
Thought Bubble.

Fiona Stephenson’s 
pin-up art appeared 

on the first issue of 
Vertigo’s Bodies.

Clark says he wants people to be able 
to come to the show and discover  
their new favourite creator or comic.

Andrew Wildman is perhaps best 
known for his work on Transformers. 
His self-penned series, HORIZON, 
will be on show at Thought Bubble.

about atmosphere, mood and comfort. I try 

to make sure I’m setting up a place where I 

can get in a creative mood and focus on my 

work for several hours a day, without getting 

burned out or irritated. The room is usually 

kept relatively dark to avoid glare on the 

screen, and I have a lot of soft lighting to 

create a nice mood. 

I work at this upstairs desk for most of the 

day and then in the evening I tend to go 

downstairs to watch TV while continuing  

my work on my laptop. 

It’s nice to have a change of scenery in  

the evening, and there are some tasks that 

I’ll save for when I’m on my laptop (anything 

that doesn’t require extra concentration or 

careful colour calibration). 

I feel I should disclose that I’m generally 

not allowed to keep anything on the top of 

the bookshelf. If I happen to stay up late 

working, my cat jumps up on that top shelf

adjusting them until I get it just right, and  

I like how it’s set up currently.

I bought this for a facial anatomy class – it’s a really

out the face, but I’ve never managed to get it all off. 

These are a few figurines that I’ve had forever and

A print by Ciruelo Cabral I got at SDCC. I thought it 
was particularly lovely. A lot of his work is more 
detailed, but I like the looser brushstrokes here. 

I really enjoy the

and I like to have a few 
of my favourites nearby 
to wear while I’m 
working (the rest of my 
massive collection is in 
my room in a drawer).

This was gorgeously sculpted by Andrew Cawrse. 
It’s been very handy, but I just realised I’ve been lazy 
and haven’t practised from it as much as I meant to.

I took a piece of manzanita wood, LED  
lights and translucent Sculpey, and made  
a mushroom log with little glowing 
mushrooms. It adds to the atmosphere.

This dragon is a sculpture 
from PurplecatCreatives on 
Etsy. I really like her style.

Giving Harry Potter 
a brand new look

This month sees the release 

of the first illustrated Harry 

Potter book, with 

Bloomsbury aiming to 

publish the sequels annually 

over the next six years. The Philosopher’s 

Stone will be available from 6 October, 

and will feature illustrations by renowned 

artist Jim Kay.

    Working day and night, stopping only 

to “sleep and walk the dog”, Jim is set to 

produce 110 colour pictures for JK Rowling’s 

blockbuster fantasy series. To create his 

artwork Jim primarily uses watercolours and 

pencils, but also incorporates oils and 

acrylics. “I’m not a purist about materials,”  

he says. “I like using damaged brushes  

rather than brand new ones – they create 

interesting marks.”

One of the biggest challenges for Jim has 

been dealing with the expectations from 

fans. To help him serve both the story and 

the readers, he’s referenced descriptions 

found in other Harry Potter books, including 

titles outside of the main series, like Fantastic 

Beasts and Where to Find Them.

Making magic Fantasy artist Jim Kay has been tasked 
with illustrating one of the biggest series in literature

Having signed up to illustrate all seven 

books, Jim is considering a break after The 

Prisoner Of Azkaban, to complete his own 

projects (see his art at www.jimkay.co.uk). 

“But I could do this all day, every day,” he 

says. “It’s the job of a lifetime.”

You can order Harry Potter and the 

Philosopher’s Stone Illustrated Edition from 

Bloomsbury: http://ifxm.ag/hpbloomsbury.

Jim reveals that he based this illustration of Harry’s 
close friend Hermione on his niece.

Giant gamekeeper 
Hagrid was one of  
Jim’s favourite 
characters to draw.

By painting Draco 
Malfoy symmetrically,  
Jim added a little 
creepiness to  
the character.

eagerly awaiting an email for the

attempts, I’ve got no emails. Am  
I doing something wrong?

Beren replies There are a couple 
steps to take, Graeme. First, go to  
www.creativebloq.com/game-art, then fill 
your email and country and click the Submit 
button. Then check your inbox, confirm 
you’re human, and then you’ll receive 
another email with the link to download  
the mega game art ebook. BOOM!

Back to basics
I’ve been a game artist for a mobile gaming 
company for the past two years. I was lucky 
to get the job based on its need for a flash 
artist, which I am.

It started off well, but I was more of a tech 
artist than an artist and I’ve been improving 
my art as I work. However, I don’t think the 
company believes I’m improving fast 
enough, so I may be out of work soon.

Which leaves me wondering if I should 
go back into full-time education. I’m 33 
years old so have been working for about  
10 years. I have saved enough to support 
myself and do a course in art foundations, 
which I feel I missed out on. I did a degree 
in animation, but it was awful. With so 
many short courses online these days, 
would it be better to create myself a more 
bespoke learning experience that way?

Also, is there an online directory for all  
of ImagineFX’s published articles?
Rick, via email

Beren replies First off, I hope you aren’t 
laid off Rick – that would suck. I’m also 
interested in why the animation course was 
such a stinker? But if you’re seriously 
thinking of getting back into art, the

fundamentals are a pretty damn good place 
to start. I’ve just come back from a week at 
the art festival Trojan Horse was a Unicorn, 
in which I heard digital art luminaries Craig 
Mullins, Robh Ruppel and, well, just about 
everyone I spoke to, stress the importance of 
mastering the fundamentals of drawing.

Craig personally said that going to an 
actual school was important for him, as it 
instilled these basics into his art brain. But if 
you have the drive, I’m sure you can make 
the most of online classes. 

As for our online presence, you will find a 
good selection of ImagineFX articles over at  
www.creativebloq.com. It’s not all our stuff, 
but has plenty of workshops and shorter tips 
from the best artists around. Good luck!

Age ain’t nothing  
but a number
Let me take a moment to thank you and the 
team at ImagineFX for such a wonderful 
magazine. I look forward to reading it every 
month, and always learn something new. It 
inspires me to continue my studies and 
improve my skills.

Which leads to my question: is there such 
a thing as “too old” to break into the 
illustration business? I’m 48 years old and 
contemplating a change of career back to my 
first love of art. I wonder how difficult it will 
be at my age to get established in the field, 
though. I’d like to think the quality of the 
art would be more important than my age, 
but I’m curious what your opinion is. Any 
insights would be appreciated.

Thanks very much!
Maalus Malefecti, via email

Beren replies Wow! It must be the 
positioning of the stars and moon – people 
are itching for a change into the art world! 
My first impulse is to say, “Hell no!” Age 
shouldn’t be the basis of an art director 
saying yea or nay to employing you. That’s 
the principle. The reality is a little more 
murky. Truth is, it depends. It depends on 
where your skills were at before you 
originally changed career. It depends if you 
have an absolute burning passion to do art, 
going back to sharpening your drawing 
skills if need be, studying all hours of the 
day and night. Ultimately, it depends on the 
standard of your art right now. Speaking of 
which, send it in – I’d love to see it!

Houston replies

the way fires cause damage to 
lives and structures has 
remained the same, and always 
will. therefore, a firefighter of 

the future will have essentially the same 
needs and tasks that a present-day 
firefighter has. the main difference is that 
technology can improve upon things that 
are cumbersome or not as efficient as they 
are in the present day – and this is where 
your role as a concept artist begins. 

Start the design process by asking 
yourself a simple question: what do 
firefighters need? they need tools to put 
out flames and destroy barriers or 
entrapments. they need equipment that 
ensures their own safety: protective heat-
resistant clothing, an oxygen supply, lights 
and alarms that activate if the wearer stops 
breathing, for example. 

after that, try and figure out how those 
needs could be improved by technology 
(even if the technology doesn’t exist yet 
– you’ll have to use your imagination 
and some artistic licence here!). 
perhaps to solve the problem of 
having to wear a heavy, limited-
supply oxygen canister, 
advances in technology 
have enabled the creation 
of a lightweight mask 
that converts the carbon 
dioxide in the burning 
environment into an 
infinite oxygen supply for the 
wearer to breath. maybe this mask also 
features a virtual heads-up display that 
monitors the wearer’s own breathing 
pattern and provides environmental 
assessments in real time.  

having these questions in mind will give 
you a solid groundwork to begin coming 
up with your future firefighter.

Characters on a white 
background can have 
their charm, but 
nothing sells a design 
better than when it 
exists in a setting.

Question
What advice do you have for drawing  
an animal-human hybrid?
Joel Tse, Australia

Answer
Jia-Ying replies

when fusing one component with 
another, i always consider the 
prominent features of either one. 
animal-human hybrids can be 

particularly fun to plan, because the possibilities 
are endless and there’s no right or wrong. 

Before i go into designing such a character, the 
research comes first. i look up photos of that 
animal, decide on what characteristics to adopt 
into the design, and i also ask myself if there are 
any interesting details i can add to make this 
character more showy. For instance, the red 
markings on this fox-human hybrid are 
comparable to those found on some Japanese fox 
masks. the important thing, however, is that it 
should be obvious which animal i’m drawing the 
inspiration or taking the qualities from. 

in this case, the ears and tail should already 
show what sort of half-creature he is, but i also 
wanted to embody a bit of playfulness that’s 
sometimes associated with the fox. the posing of 
the character is also essential in giving us some 
background to both their personality and 

For fine details, I use a regular 
airbrush in Photoshop. Omitting line 
art also gives a softer feel, which is 
useful for elements such as fur.

I worked with the obvious 
of a fox, such as the pointed 
ears and black-brown of its 
legs. Having references at 
hand is essential.

 I begin by working on the overall design and the graphic read of the 
silhouette. I imagine a protective suit that’s 
less bulky than typical firefighter garb, and 
a helmet/mask/rebreather hybrid. I kept 
the reflective rectangular strips to make 
the new silhouette recognisable as a 
firefighter’s uniform.

 After establishing a strong, simple graphic silhouette, I can explore other 
angles and dive into details. This three-
quarters view enables me to explore 
details, such as the exhaust vents on the 
helmet, and the tubes going from the arm-
mounted vapour gun to the small water 
supply on the wearer’s back.

 Once the design is looking good from multiple angles, I test out different 
colour variations, taking care not to lose 
the strong graphic shapes that were 
established in values during step one. 
Here, I try recognisable firefighter colours, 
but it’s a good idea to also explore unusual 
colour schemes, too.

Brush up on it!
i sometimes use a rectangular

 

brush for objects with an 

unrefined texture. there are 

many free brushes online – 

spend time seeing which brush
es 

work best for certain textures.

Artist’s secret

animal trait. a snake-human hybrid, for 
example, would likely be posed in a curvy, 
provocative manner, because as humans we 
often perceive the snake as being the cunning, 
bewitching type (due to its appearance in 
literature over the years, no doubt). 

one thing i note to myself is not to overdo the 
fur, if any. i want a clean, simple style overall – 
just a hint of some individual strands and tufts of 
fur will be enough to convey a fluffy, foxy look.

Step-by-step: creating a city environment concept

Answer
Charlotte replies

there are a lot of tools out there 
that can help make even the 
most complex environment 
design manageable, from 

thumbnail to final product. 3d programs 
(here i’ll be using Sketchup) can streamline 
the process; when you begin to combine 
these with phototextures and well-thought 
out lighting effects, you can quickly create a 
visually interesting piece of art that sells 
your environment idea.

there are a few different ways to 
approach environment design: for sci-fi and 
terrascape art the Shapes tool is invaluable, 
whereas for modern cityscapes starting 
with a photo plate can be much quicker. 
other urban environments or detailed 
matte painting style artwork can benefit 
from 3d in the initial stages. and of course, 
many artists just use free form painting 
from start to finish, forgoing photos and 
other programs altogether. experiment 
with these different methods until you find 
an approach that works best.

one quick trick is using magic hour 
lighting in your artwork. this creates 
dramatic mood, vivid colour and long 
shadows that are universally flattering.

 I’ll be making a fantasy cityscape, so 3D is useful 
for establishing accurate 
perspective – the biggest killer 
of urban environments. I use 
SketchUp to block out a 
fantasy city by creating a few 
interesting buildings, and 
copying and arranging them 
throughout the environment. 
Using the camera function,  
I compose a snapshot to serve 
as a base for my 2D concept.

 I import the file to Photoshop and use the 
image as a guideline, painting 
over the base using a simple 
colour scheme to preserve the 
shapes from my model. I try  
to avoid detail, remaining 
zoomed out while I block in  
the buildings of the picture. 
Don’t feel locked into your 3D 
design – this is a good stage at 
which to add new large 
elements to your concept.

 When you’re happy with your design you can start 
adding detail. This can be  
done by hand or by using 
photo textures. When applying 
photo textures, make use of 
masks instead of the Erase tool 
and start out by using an 
adjustment layer to make sure 
the values of the photo match 
the values of your painting. If 
these two things don’t match 
it’ll never look right!

 I decide to add an extra element to improve the 
overall composition. Bright red 
flags offer a complementary 
colour to make the rooftop 
gardens pop, as well as helping 
to lead the eye of the viewer 
around the image. After this 
stage I add two per cent grain 
and tilt-shift blur to the 
painting, as well as applying 
some linear dodge around the 
skyline to enhance the sunset.

Working in values

if you’re using complex light 
sources or shapes, 

working in black and white c
an really 

simplify the early stages. try 
creating a black 

fill layer set to Color blending
 mode, so that 

you can check your work in m
onochrome.

Try creating a 3D base for your

Question
What are occlusion shadows, and how  
should I apply them to my artwork?
Sara Pierce, England

Answer
Bram replies

when doing detailed lighting work 
i’ve gotten into the habit of 
simplifying each step of the painting 
process as much as possible. 

Focusing my attention on one aspect at a time 
helps to not become overwhelmed and almost 
always results in a much more thorough job. 

one step in that process is concentrating on 
occlusion shadows, which occur where surfaces 
come together. a basic rule of thumb is that 
wherever areas are closed in by surfaces, 
shadows will occur. the inside of a mouth or an 

eye socket for instance will almost always be 
darker than the top of the nose or the forehead. 
they’re a form of shadows best noticeable when 
there’s no directional light present. So you can 
paint them on a separate layer without having 
to worry about the direction of the overall 
lighting, and then set that layer to multiply to 
have it distribute the shadows on the objects 
below. in my example however, i do have a 
lighting scheme in mind with directional lights 
and cast shadows, but these build upon the 
occlusion shadows rather than replacing them.

Step-by-step:
give an orc  
realistic lighting

 Every good painting starts with a good foundation. In this case it’s a 
quick line drawing that looks very simple, 
but has all the information in it I need to 
finish the painting. It shows the placing of 
all the facial features, but also where the 
cast shadows will fall and how the back 
lighting will push the silhouette forward.

 Built upon the previous sketch is the occlusion layer. You’ll notice that it’s  
a very bright layer with light greyish tones 
in it, and the reason for that is that we 
don’t want to overdo the shadows in the 
image. By keeping this layer light the 
Multiply layer won’t ‘burn’ my friendly-
looking orc character below.

 With the occlusion layer in Multiply I paint over the line drawing with larger 
strokes to erase the big lines while keeping 
the major volumes. The lines aren’t really 
needed since the layout of the elements is 
present in the occlusion layer, too. The 
heavy lifting is now mostly done and all 
that remains is adding colour and effects.

Occlusion shadows help to push 
the three-dimensional feeling of 
what you’re painting. Look for 
areas enclosed by surfaces and 
notice how the shadows are 
always darker there.

Lighting is never an easy thing 
to make convincing in a 
painting, but spotlighting in 
particular allows for a lot of 

simplification, which makes your job 
easier. Being the only light source in the 
image is definitely a component, but what 
really makes a spotlit figure both easy and 
convincing is the massing and 
subordination of the shadow shapes.

The key phrase to remember is: 
information in the light, no information in 
the shadow. Group your shadow shapes 
into big, distinct masses that have little to 
no form or detail. Because the spotlit figure 
is in a very dark setting, there won’t be 
much in the environment for the spotlight

to achieve richness in 

colour, place small amounts 

of different colours of 

similar value next to each 

other in a few areas in 

your painting. this makes 

them ‘vibrate’ in the

extensively in their art.
The key to creating a compelling spotlit figure is

A simple composition is a strong composition.

at hair in simple sections, as opposed to 
attempting realism by painting every strand 
– which is a pretty respectable talent on its 
own, but not quite what we’re looking for in 
manga style. Details like hints of stray 
strands can be added in later on.

As crazy as some manga hairstyles  
can get, it’s important to play between 
fantasy and reality carefully. Essentially, 
what we’re looking for is to create a 
believable hair structure that will not only 
complement the character’s face, but also 
help in giving appeal and identity. 

to bounce off of and influence the shadows 
on the figure. These large, simplified 
shadow shapes are important to the 
composition as well as the spotlight effect, 
so try to design these well. 

To balance this emptiness of the dark 
areas, all of the form and detail must be 
emphasised in the lit areas of the figure. 
Because there will probably be a lot of 
empty darkness in the image, the form, 
texture and colour in the light side needs  
to be really interesting to strike a good 
balance within the composition. Build up 
the form gradually and dramatically all  
the way up to a punchy highlight, the way 
an epic orchestral song builds up its 
powerful crescendo.

Focusing on separate 
portions of the hair 
instead of fussing 
over details simplifies 
the process.

 I sometimes sketch out the bald head underneath beforehand, to give

hair in thick masses, taking note of the 
point of origin: in this case it’s roughly  
the top left of his scalp. 

 I use lighter values of the hair’s base colour to add details, such as thinner

Question
Help me depict a dragon who’s been in a few fights
Noah Crawford, US

Answer
Leesha replies

The ability to paint wear and 
tear can support both the 
characterisation of your 
creatures and the narrative 

of an illustration. Has your dragon been 
attacked with weapons or claws? If it 
gets into a fight, does it usually come 
out on top? The appearance of injuries 
can help the viewer answer these 
questions and more.

When you begin rendering in your 
scales, don’t worry about painting 
wounds until the dragon’s finished. 
Typically, scales are oval or diamond 
shaped. The scales on the face will be 
smaller than those on the body. You 
don’t have to render individual scales. 
Focus on rendering the scales where the 
light hits the skin, because that’s where 
the most detail will be present. 

To paint a recent injury, use a 
saturated dark red to outline the gash, 
and fill it with a lighter red. Use dark 
pink in the middle of the wound for 
exposed flesh. Paint a subtle highlight 
around the edges of a wound for torn 
skin. If there’s a lot of blood oozing out 
of the wound, add a few specular 
highlights to the drops of blood. 

Consider adding some tears to a 
dragon’s wings. On a new layer, paint  
in a hole using the colour of the 
background. Add some subtle pink 
colours around the edges of the tear to 
imply inflammation.

Just a flesh wound!

blood will run into the 

creases of the dragon’s scales. 

this will further emphasise 

their shape and form. some 

scales can also be ‘stained ’ 

with a subtle red colour.

Step-by-step: Create a phoenix in Photoshop

 First, create a basic silhouette and colour palette for your creature. If 
you’re adding effects to a creature you’ve 
already rendered, just pick an existing 
colour from its body and change your HSB 

sliders so that both 
the saturation and 
brightness are set to 
a higher level. Use 
Soft brushes for the 
dark shades and 
Hard brushes for 
lighter ones.

 Because I’m drawing a phoenix, I try to incorporate fire-based light effects 
by merging flames with long elegant 
fractals. I want my creature to be flying 
upwards, so all my brushstrokes should 

flow smoothly from 
the top right of my 
painting to the 
bottom left. I remove 
some colour from 
the chest and head 
of the bird to mimic 
the look of a flame.

 For the epicentre of your effects, the light will usually be bright and opaque. 
You can use Color Dodge blending or 
Brush mode to quickly fill this in, or do it 
manually by turning both your Saturation 

and Brightness 
sliders up to 100 per 
cent. I’m aiming  
for a spark-type 
effect here, using  
a hot white colour 
and splintering 
straight lines.

Pay close attention to the 
direction of your brush 
strokes. As long as you 
keep these consistent your 
magical effects will look 
flowing and natural.

Combine super-saturated fractal 
patterns with natural elemental 
effects to create convincing 
magical auras for your creatures. 
Control the translucency of your 
layers as you experiment.

Question
My magical creature effects just look like standard 
Photoshop filters – how can I improve them?
Mai Yeoh, Canada

Answer
Charlotte replies

It can be tricky to design and 
paint magical effects from 
scratch. This is why there are so 
many custom brushes out there 

that have been created to make this process 
easier. However, if you take the time to 
understand how different specular effects 
are supposed to work, you’ll find that 
drawing your magical effects by hand will 
make your painting not only more unique, 
but also more interesting to render.

The first step to making believable 
magical effects is researching the way that 
light behaves in different situations. 
Flames, fireworks, sparking, bio-
luminescence, water fractals… all of these 
things make good starting points for light 
effects. Once you’ve chosen your references, 
think about how you can combine these 
effects. It becomes easier to make one effect 
flow into another if you add direction to 
your brushstrokes; make a decision about 
where your magic is moving to and stick to 
it. This will add realism to your painting.

When it comes to magical effects, 
blending modes can be helpful, 
particularly Color Dodge. If you find your 
picture is looking a bit lifeless, you can 
create a new layer in Dodge mode and 
gently add paint with a soft Round brush 
to increase the saturation of your other 
layers and give them an ethereal, glowing 
effect. Remember that the best-looking 
magical effects always preserve some 
translucency, so don’t go overboard!

Veronica. Dating back to 1939, the title has 
huge resonance in the US and its publisher 
has revived it with Mark Wiard writing.

For Fiona, the process is a little different 
to Saga. She explains: “I do full-colour work 
for Saga, and Archie is coloured by Andre 
Szymanowicz. This was meant to save me 
time, but it still takes me longer to draw 
Archie because everything has to look 
somewhat realistic. A car has to look like a 
real car and a school has to look like a 
school. In Saga I’d just draw some stupid 
dome thing or flying fruit.”

Archie was the seventh best-selling comic 
when the new issue one came out in July,

hoW SaGa 
comeS to life
The epic space drama of love and war has 
become a hit, thanks to Fiona’s exceptional art

Working alongside writer Brian K 
Vaughan, Fiona Staples is the artist 
behind Saga, one of the most eclectic 
and unusual comics you’re ever likely 
to read. It’s creator-owned, and 
perhaps that’s the reason why it ever 
saw the light of day.

“I never felt like a hired gun. All 
Saga decisions are made by both of 
us, from scheduling to foreign edition 
deals to T-shirt designs,” says Fiona.

“I don’t know exactly where the 
story is headed long-term, so I just 
take it month by month! Hazel is 
growing up fast, and the rest of the 
family is ageing a bit as well, less 
obviously. I try to have their 
appearance reflect their 
circumstances. The last story arc 
saw the family separated, and 
Marko and Alana looking pretty 
haggard. When we come back to them they’re going to be 
more in adventure mode.”

Like her other comics, Saga is drawn digitally using 
Photoshop and Manga Studio. “I love being able to work  
in colour, instead of having to scan in inks and colour 
afterwards. Digital is freeing to me, because I can get the 
image in my mind onto the screen with very little 
interference. For instance, I can pick a colour with a click 
instead of washing my paintbrush and mixing the colour  
on a palette every time. I can paint white-on-black as  
easily as black-on-white. There are no physical barriers  
to worry about,” she says.

later seen in Saga, and came out through 
the DC imprint Wildstorm.

In 2010, Mystery Society came along and 
in it Fiona worked similarly to how she does 
now. “This book is significant because it’s 
when I moved back to doing creator-owned 
work. I’d spent a few years doing work-for-
hire for various companies and didn’t mind, 
but I wanted at least a percentage of what I 
came up with,” she says.

And perhaps that’s one of the most 
inspiring things about Fiona’s approach to 
comics. Not only has she been leading the 
way with unusual and thought-provoking 

artwork, she takes risks and wants to take 
ownership of what she creates – not sell it 
off to one of the big boys in the market.

“I know books like Saga are the 
exception, and most indie books can’t be 
sustained for long, much less counted on to 
be profitable. But I’m hoping this will 
change and creator-owned books become a 
viable option for more creators. 

“The more the market grows, the more 
indie titles publishers like Image, Boom, 
and Dynamite will be able to sustain, so I 
think it’s crucial to make accessible comics 
for a wide range of tastes,” she concludes. 

ArcHIe
This title couldn’t be  
more different to Saga in 
so many ways. Will it be 
the right next step for 
Fiona Staples? Early 
signals are positive.

hese days, there are more indie 
game studios in the UK than 
you can shake a stick at.  
But Blazing Griffin is a little 

different, says its creative director for 
games, Stephen Hewitt. Its size might be 
small but its dreams are big. “We’re looking 

to create high-end indie 
games that will position us 
somewhere between quality 
indie and triple-A,” he says. 
“We’re a young and 

precocious studio that has done a lot  
of things that larger and less-agile studios 
wouldn’t even consider. And it’s worked  
out pretty well so far.”

It’s still early days for the studio. Set up 
in Edinburgh in 2011, it’s learning as it 
goes. In 2012, for example, it launched an 
unsuccessful Kickstarter campaign to fund 
a sequel to The Ship: Murder Party. 

Stephen says this wasn’t an entirely 
negative experience. “The failure was more 
down to our own ignorance over how 
Kickstarter works than anything inherently 
wrong with what we were trying to do,” he 
explains. “And we learned a lot of valuable 
lessons about crowdfunding along the way.”

LOVE LETTER
It’s shelving the Ship sequel for the time 
being and instead starting work on  
The Ship: Remasted, an HD remake of the 
original title, which it acquired when the 
original developer, Outerlight, went out of 
business. Another ongoing project is

Creating artwork for indie games can be a rewarding, if hectic, 
experience. We chat to a small Scottish studio with big dreams

Distant Star: Revenant Fleet, a real-time, 
space-strategy game for PC launched with 
last November that boasts some stunning 
looking spacecraft and alien environments.

“Distant Star was a bit of a love letter to 
sci-fi artists like Chris Foss and Syd Mead, 
as well as films like Blade Runner and the 

game Homeworld,” says art 
director Paul Scott Canavan. 
“I always loved the vibrant 
visuals of that game and the 
way Blade Runner was lit has 

always been hugely inspiring to me. Shape 
design was important in Distant Star and  
I wanted to simplify the ships as much as 
possible, to make them instantly readable 
as different factions.”

But although the work is rewarding, it 
has to be done quickly. “The biggest 
challenge I have day to day is just managing 
several projects at once,” Paul says. “It’s 

 We’re a precocious studio 
that has done things big

Web: www.blazinggriffin.com

What’s your background?
After studying Illustration and 
printmaking at art college, I started 
off in animation then made the 
change to illustration. I got involved 
with games by helping out with 
concept art for Abertay University 
students who needed an artist. I’d 
contact people who had left ads on 
the art college noticeboard, and it 
spiralled from there.

What does your role involve?
I work on concepts, game textures, 
graphic design, and recently many 
aspects of the 3D work required in 
the studio. I’m constantly learning 
new skills that I can put into practice, 
while also bringing my traditional art 
and design experience to the team. 
A typical day might involve setting 
up collision for all the staircases in a 
game level, and in the afternoon 
helping with logo rebranding. 

How did you get the job?
After my previous role at a smaller 
games company came to an end, I 
really wanted to continue working in 
games, and I knew the Blazing Griffin 
guys were really pushing hard in the 
Scottish games scene. I contacted 
Paul Canavan in regards to future 
employment, and as the guys 
already knew my work and 
background, they brought me on 
board almost instantly!

What’s the latest project you’ve 
worked on?
Recently we’ve been working on The 
Ship: Remasted, and I’ve honestly 
learnt more than I ever thought I 
could. Some of the areas where I feel 
I’ve developed the most include 
lighting (both traditional and digital), 
textures and modelling. 

What process do you follow when 
creating game artwork?
We’re all pretty big advocates of 
drawing here. Most of my ideas 
begin with a sketch. I always carry a 
sketchbook and pencil case. We also 
share all of our work and concepts 
round the art team for feedback. I 
feel this is an important step in 
developing work, moving on, and 
not getting too bogged down, by 
always offering each other 
inspiration and ideas.

What’s the working environment 
really like at Blazing Griffin?
Professional, yet fun. We take part in 
many activities including art class, 
post work drinks, and playing games 
with each other. Everyone gets on 
really well, everyone is willing to help, 
and most people here will tell you it’s 
more of a family than anything else.

pretty rare for my role to exist on one 
game alone: I’m generally doing some 
concept on this project, some 
preproduction on another and maybe a bit 
of sketching for stuff I know is coming up 
in the future. It’s definitely exciting to jump 
between projects and push my creativity 
but it can get a little overwhelming.”

Paul approaches each project in a 
different way. “My process changes all the 
time,” he says. “Sometimes I’ll start on 
paper and scan the image into Photoshop, 
other times I’ll begin with silhouettes and 
use light to carve into them. I’ve been 
experimenting with 3D lately and trying to 
see how it fits into my workflow – I think 
it’s important to try everything these days, 
there’s no reason not to experiment.”

And it’s important to go the extra mile to 
get it right, he believes, because superior art 
direction can help a small company like 
Blazing Griffin bat above their weight. 

“Strong art design can elevate even a 
simple video game to something so much 
greater,” he enthuses. “The most important 
aspect of concept art isn’t your ability to 
paint, it’s your ability to think and to be 
imaginative. Games like Monument Valley, 
Journey and Limbo are well designed but 
without their astonishing art direction I 
doubt they’d have had the impact they did.”

So what’s it like to work at Blazing 
Griffin? “For me, it’s the best example of a 

small studio atmosphere with 
big studio aspirations,” says 
2D/UI artist Searra Dodds. 
“We have a lot of daft office 
traditions, including ping 

pong tournaments and Ham Day – the 
official Blazing Griffin holiday. We are a 
pretty silly team, but we also have a lot of 
passion and drive to create beautiful, 

immersive, fun games.”
A recent starter, junior 

programmer Martin Scott 
tells a similar story. “The 
company is like a large 

family,” he says. “Being fairly small, all 
departments work closely together, 
meaning everyone gets to know everyone 
else. We often end early on a Friday to 
mingle and play games.”

TaLEnT spOTTing
If that sounds like your kind of office, 
Stephen urges you to consider working at 
Blazing Griffin. “We’re always on the 
lookout for talented people, so I’d keep an 
eye on our recruitment page,” he says. 
“There’s plenty of space here for new 
starters to make a name for themselves, and 
a really great opportunity to grow as the 
company does likewise.”

So what kind of artists is Blazing Griffin 
looking for? “People who can express 
themselves imaginatively, and can work 
semi-autonomously with a responsible 
attitude,” says Stephen. “We’d rather be 
wowed by what artists can do, than have to 
bug them every five seconds to keep them 
on track. Also, we’re looking for people who 
can all get along together,” he adds. “The 
whole team gets a chance to hang out with 
potential employees before we hire them. 
And of course, that gives you a chance to 
see if you like us too!”

How to paint a 
girl and Her tank
Cartoonist Brett parson presents his take on the iconic Tank Girl, using the 
drawing tools of SketchBook Pro and colouring techniques in Photoshop

o I must have been either 11 or 
12 years old when I first 
discovered Tank Girl. A 
comic book museum that I 

would go to, often several times a month, 
was having an exhibit of all the artwork 
from the original series. This was my first 
introduction to Tank Girl, to the art of 
Jamie Hewlett (now famous for creating 
the cartoon band Gorillaz), and to the 
bizarre slap-stick writing of Alan Martin... 
it would change my young brain forever. 

It was the first time I realised that 
comics can be fun. Twenty years later  
and I’ve had the honour of working with 
Alan Martin on a few Tank Girl stories, 
which are hopefully helping a whole new 
generation of warped young minds to 
discover her.

Now if you’re thinking, “Who the 
#$@! is Tank Girl?”, do yourself a favour 
and buy as many books as you can. But if 
you’re already a fan, then you’ll 
understand how excited I was when

ImagineFX contacted me about having 
her on the cover. This workshop reveals 
my process of creating an image of Tank 
Girl from the rough sketch and final line 
work in SketchBook Pro, to the finished 
colours in Photoshop. It’ll help to have an 
understanding of basic drawing methods, 
and how to treat light and shadow. But all 
of these techniques can be applied to a 
wide range of skill sets and styles. So strap 
on your boots, slap a Band Aid on your 
head, and let’s have some fun!

S

1 Rough sketchI find SketchBook Pro to have a much more natural 
feeling for drawing than Photoshop. And its rulers and circle 
tools can’t be beat. So using SketchBook Pro, I create a sketch of 
how I want the cover to look. This gives me an idea of how 
everything will fit together; it takes into consideration where 
different cover elements, such as text and titles, will go.

2 Clean up the sketchSometimes it seems like overkill, but I often do a trace of 
the roughs to clean things up before I move on to finished lines. 
I lower the Opacity of the existing layer, and create a new layer 
on top of that. Using a light colour and a soft Pencil brush  
I quickly trace over the image, adding a few elements and 
removing some that I no longer want.

at your vision
Don’t always settle for
your first choice. Often
after I’ve finished
colouring, I’ll create
duplicates of certain
layers and play with the
colours. This gives me a
chance to visualise other
ideas that I might not
have thought of while
getting my initial colour 
scheme down.

In depth A girl and her tank



Spend time  
on your lines
The lines are the 
backbone of  your art.
Let them shine! Play
around using fat, skinny
or tapered lines. A 
good variety of weights 
and styles is sure to keep
the viewer interested. It
can also help to make
certain parts of the 
artwork stand out, and 
others fall back. 

4 Layering the drawingAs I’m drawing my finished line work, I break the drawing 
up using separate layers. This makes it much easier to edit 
colours and add depth in the colouring stage. In this drawing  
I create a layer for the foreground, and for the background. If 
there were other characters or elements I would usually place 
them on their own layer as well.

7 Time for some cel shadingNow I add animation-style cel shading. I create a new 
layer, set it to Multiply and place it between the colour and line 
art. Then I add shadows, using a light grey brush at 100 per cent 
Opacity. By setting the layer to Multiply it enables the colours 
underneath to show through, but become darker.

6 Adding colour holdsChanging the colour of the lines can take things up a 
notch. To do this I hold Cmd (Mac) or Ctrl (PC) and click a layer 
of line art (this will select only the lines). I then colour over the 
lines, usually only on Tank Girl’s skin and lighter objects in the 
scene. I try to not go too crazy; it’s very easy to go overboard 
during this stage – the voice of experience!

5 Blocking flat coloursNow that I’ve finished my line art, I start the colouring 
process in Photoshop. I create a new layer under each layer of 
line drawings, and fill in that element with a solid colour. Then 
holding down either Cmd (Mac) or Ctrl (PC) I click the colour 
layer to select it, and fill in all the different colours.

3 Finishing the line workNow it’s time to clean up the drawing and tighten up the 
lines. Again, I lower the Opacity of my current layer and create a 
new layer. I use a modified Pencil tool and a darker colour to 
trace over the sketch below, adding variation in line weight to 
give the drawing more personality.

8 Airbrush shadingUsing the Wand selection tool on the layer of colours 
enables me to select certain areas to work on at a time. Next,  
I create a new layer that’s set to Multiply above the colour layer.  
I select an Airbrush tool on a very low Opacity (which is also  
set to Multiply), and add gradient shading and pink skin hues 
where I want them.

Have fun!
I know it sounds corny 
but having fun while you 
work is the most 
important thing. 
Otherwise the work 
suffers and you’re left 
with a lifeless, 
uninteresting drawing – 
no matter how well it’s 
drawn. I find that being 
in a good mood and 
having fun is key to 
putting living, breathing 
life into your artwork 

10 Colouring background elementsNow I fill in the different colours of the background, 
making sure to pick colours that don’t blend with or drown out 
the main character. Using a different palette helps if there are 
elements in the background that I want to stand out. For 
example, I want the tank to be visible, and so using cool colours 
helps it pop against the warm sand.

9 Adding highlightsI create a Screen layer above my layers of shading. Then  
I select the colour layer, hold down Cmd+Alt (Mac) or Ctrl+Alt 
(PC) and click the Cel Shading layer, which has the effect of 
deselecting the shadows. With an Airbrush tool on a low Opacity 
level and using the colour of each area that I’m working on, I’m 
now able to add highlights where necessary.

13 Using colour correctionI’ll play with the overall palette throughout the colouring 
process. By using Hue/Saturation, Color Balance and Brightness/
Contrast I’m able to change tones of different colours and 
different shadows. The ability to play with colours at any stage of 
the piece is one of the biggest benefits of working digitally.

11 Background shadingI create a new layer set to Multiply above the background 
colour layer. I select an Airbrush tool on a low Opacity that’s also 
set to Multiply, and add shading to both help add depth and 
make the character pop from the background more. I mask off 
areas using the Lasso section tool so that they’re ready for 
airbrushing, which helps to add even more depth.

12 Background colour holdsOn the background line art layer, I’ll often use either the 
technique from step six, or I’ll use the Hue/Saturation tool to 
change the colour and darkness of the lines. This is one instance 
where having the line art on separate layers comes in handy.  
I find that making the background lines lighter than those of  
the character introduces added depth.

14 Adding pulp textureAs a finishing touch, I add a subtle paper texture to the 
artwork to help knock back the digital vibes. I scan in a suitably 
old piece of paper, then copy and paste it on to a new layer that’s 
set to Multiply. Then I adjust the Brightness/Contrast and layer 
Opacity to achieve the desired level of texture. And there you 
have it: a girl and her tank! Hope you enjoyed the workshop. 

give your  
eyes a break
Often when I’m working
on a single piece for
multiple hours in a row,
it’s easy to become blind
to problems with the
drawing. Before moving
on from one step to the
next, I’ll take a walk or
have a bite to eat.
Coming back with a 
fresh pair of eyes makes 
all the difference.

Leaving room 
for change
When building a 
consistent working 
process, it can be 
difficult to keep the 
results feeling fresh. 
Often, once the piece 
is nearing completion, I’ll 
apply adjustment layers, 
and effects, such as 
Curves, and experiment 
with dramatic changes 
on the graph to see how 
I can affect the image. 
I usually focus on 
shifting the hierarchy  
of the values. 

give tintin the 
fabLes treatment
nimit malavia combines traditional and digital media as he develops an 
engaging Tintin cover, painting the familiar while finding his own voice

eveloping artwork for a cover is 
rarely simple. You must 
maintain the fundamentals 
of a standalone image, such as 

a strong composition with an interesting 
palette. But the cover also has to engage 
the reader so that it’s not only appealing 
to look at, but also brings them into the 
story. Having seen some of my covers for 
Vertigo’s Fables series, the ImagineFX 

team suggested we take a swing at another 
established character: Tintin. 

Working on famed properties such as 
this is exciting, but it brings a challenge of 
interpreting the figure in a way that 
enables me to paint an image that satisfies 
my creative needs, while also remaining 
true to the character’s original spirit.

This workshop will focus on showing 
the choices I make in conceptualising the

piece. It will give you a full process 
breakdown of the technical aspects of 
creating this image: touching on the 
different stages of roughs and approval; 
working up the image with traditional 
media; building the colours and values

Photoshop; title design; plus some 
personal techniques I use to re-inject  
some mystery into the final art.

1 Narrowing the fieldI often begin a character-based project by researching all 
aspects of their history, trying to find something to connect 
with. In the case of Tintin it was understanding that throughout 
his life he has been our gateway to unknown worlds and 
adventures. A perfect canvas. Once that ball was rolling, the 

Photoshop, Illustrator & mixed media

ideas couldn’t be stopped. In Photoshop, using a customised 
Round brush that emulates a ball-point pen, I develop eight 
black and white thumbnails – each with its own unique story 
and setting. I can’t decide which one to go for, so I send them all 
to the ImagineFX team for approval and a decision.

3 Revising and refiningNow I begin revising the line drawing, making decisions 
on the design of the characters, environment, placing the blacks 
and using different elements to help navigate the viewer’s eye 
– the shape of the fire, for example. I try to be as economical as  
I can at this point, keeping the lines simple and not investing too 
much time in the details.

6 Setting the lighting schemeAfter laying down the colour flats I establish where my 
light source will be, and how the shadows will play on the 
figures and elements. I develop these with numerous Multiply 
layers, using an adjusted oil pastel brush, building the shadows 
of the piece in a very gradual way.

5 Laying down flatsAs my digital process becomes more and more involved, 
it’s essential that I take the time to create aliased colour flats. 
They serve to help make quick selections on different elements 
of the image that I might want to isolate and treat individually, 
especially in a dense composition. Keeping them aliased also 
helps to ensure crisp selections.

4 Pencil to paperFrom there I print out the image to be traced, using a light 
box and a 2H pencil, on to a 14x21-inch sheet of BFK Rives. 
Once the basic shapes are down, I switch to a Faber-Castell 
Schwarz Black and begin drawing proper. Along with 
articulating the details, I want to solidify my blacks.

2 Decisions of directionWe narrow it down to two options: Mayan Cave and Airplane Escape. Either idea 
would’ve been a joy to execute, but as exciting as the rope-ladder escape would have been, it 
makes Tintin feel like an action star rather than someone who is being swept up in the 
adventure, as he is in the comics.

7 Painting in valuesWhile the image is currently poorly detailed, I’m careful 
not to overpolish it. One usual pitfall is to render the same level 
of detail throughout the image. Despite all the articulation, it 
can feel static in the end. So I concentrate on more expressive 
painting techniques for the focal points, and limit the rendering 
in the secondary areas.

Limiting your 
colour palette
If you’ve started a 
drawing and find 
yourself uncertain how 
to proceed, building 
your values up in 
greyscale then applying 
limited colour using
either an Overlay layer
or Gradient Map
adjustment layer can
help to find a mood and 
focus for your piece. 
Experimenting with 
complementary warm 
and cool tones can be 
helpful, too. 

9 Warmth in the cool areasI need to bring some warmth and glow to the sculpture in the background. Using a 
gradient map adjustment layer and careful layer masking, I begin painting out the glow from 
the flames on the affected stones behind Tintin. I go in over the top of a Normal layer to add 
some specular highlights to the sculpture.

13 Adding the title card Customising and incorporating the title design into the 
image is one of the perks of the job I’ve luxuriated in most with 
my covers. It’s a nice way to cleanly and cohesively wrap 
everything up. Since my execution is such a departure from 
Hergé’s original creation, I decide that a simple traditional title 
treatment in Illustrator will be best. 

8 Bringing in analog elementsUsually by this stage of the process I start to worry about 
that dreaded static feeling coming in. So I begin reintroducing 
textures over the top of different layers to vary the look or 
enhance the inherent grit of the paper. In this case, I place two 
textures from a grunge set with reduced Opacity over the top  
of the sculpture layers.

12 Bringing harmony backAt this final stage, I look for any adjustments that bring 
balance and flow back to the composition as a whole. I decide 
that the foreground elements need to be further separated, so  
I go back into the midtones and I repaint the shadows of the 
layers to bring the cooler eggplant tones in. I then apply a texture 
Overlay layer with a low Opacity.

10 Attempting to spark an ideaDissatisfied with how straightforward the colour palette 
has turned out, I begin introducing more destructive 
adjustments to the image, trying to spark an idea or any kind of 
change, using Selective Colour, Channel Mixer, Curves and so 
on. It does away with much of the work I’ve already done, but  
I find that Gradient Map offers the change I’m looking for.

11 Lighting a fireOnce I’ve finessed the colour choices from the original 
Gradient Map – the main goal being to find a complementary 
palette that unifies the image and keeps the warmth intact, using 
the flat selections in the layer mask – I begin dividing up the 
composition. This means I’m able to reduce the effect of the 
Gradient Map on certain elements, such as the fire.

create visual 
rhythms in 
your artwork
anna steinbauer reveals how she uses leading lines to 
guide the viewer’s eye through her lush fantasy artwork

his image started out as 
something I painted for fun, 
loosely inspired by 
Fantaghirò, a series of fantasy 

movies I loved when I was little. 
I thought I could use the painting as a 

new header image for my blog, so the 
initial composition was very wide and 
not too tall. These dimensions quickly 
grew when I liked the idea so much that  
I wanted a full painting, and again when 
it was decided that it would be used for 
creating this workshop.

Recropping paintings with an already 
established composition can be difficult, 
but using leading lines effectively helps. 
Every image has lines – actual or implied 
– that lead the viewer’s eyes through the 
composition. Placing these lines 
consciously gives you greater control over 
how your painting will be viewed and 
creates a sense of rhythm. 

A lot of this boils down to doing what 
feels right, which becomes much easier 
with practice, but there are some general 
ideas to help get you started. Make an

effort to arrange strands of hair, clothing, 
accessories and background elements 
such as plants or architecture to keep the 
viewer’s eye moving within the image.

When a character’s gaze leads out of the 
image, guide the viewer’s eyes back in 
with trees and foliage. Use limbs to point 
towards the focal points and reinforce 
these lines with folds in cloth that go 
along the same angle. 

Take a look at your favourite artists’ 
works and try to find where and how they 
used leading lines in their work.

Give your  
eyes a rest
Staring at a bright 
computer screen for 
hours can be exhausting
and even harmful for
your eyes. The most
obvious solution is to
take plenty of breaks,
but there’s a way to
reduce eye strain while
painting as well.
Particularly when you’re
working with very bright
or saturated colours, try 
lowering your monitor’s 
brightness. Once the 
bulk of the work is done, 
you can turn it back up to 
check your colours and 
adjust them if necessary. 

4 Changing the poseAt this point I have to leave the painting alone for a few 
days while working on other projects. Coming back to it, I realise 
that I don’t like the knight’s pose. I change the angle of her face 
using the Free Transform>Warp tool, and sketch in new arms. 
This new pose works better with the composition and conveys a 
clear sense of stern determination.

2 Clean SketchI gradually build up a clean drawing over several layers, 
paying close attention to the arrangement of the lines, especially 
in the cloth and hair. They should create a sense of rhythm, by 
creating both smaller and larger shapes and leading the eye 
through the composition in a flowing motion.

5 Recropping the imageWhat started as a personal painting with no size 
restrictions will now be used for a workshop, so I recrop the 
image to fit the required dimensions. Instead of cutting off the 
characters, I expand the canvas and include more of the 
surroundings. To keep the newly added areas interesting, I create 
a pleasing arrangement of lights and darks within the foliage.

3 Starting to paintNow I separate the characters from the background onto 
their own layers, so I can paint with big brushes while preserving 
the edges. Beginning with the main focal point - the knight’s face 
- I define some features and paint in stronger colours and values. 
I stay true to the line drawing at first, but soon rendering the 
forms reveals some mistakes I did not notice before.

1 Getting the concept downI start out with a super quick sketch to capture the 
composition and mood that I’m going for. At this point I pay no 
attention to the drawing at all – I just focus on the colours and 
the general layout. Then I refine the sketch a bit and decide to 
expand the canvas, which will enable me to show more of the 
characters and the background.

7 Repeating design elementsI spend time working on the armour, introducing a simple 
design element of repeating grooves, which helps add some 
cohesion to the overall design. As I paint, I have the light sources 
as well as the surroundings in mind, which create reflections in 
the metal. However, I keep them quite abstract to avoid making 
it look too polished or chrome-like.

6 Working on the armourInitially I wanted the wing design on the pauldron to be 
etched into the metal, but I decide that a three-dimensional form 
is the way to go. I also clean up the arms I sketched in previously, 
starting with two simple values to establish the form and further 
defining details as I move along.

8 Facial detailsI’d already painted most of the knight’s face at the 
beginning of the process, but now I add some minor details that 
should make a major difference. Specular highlights are a sure 
way to make eyes come alive, but I like to leave them out until 
the iris and eyeball are completely done. I also further refine the 
lips and overall facial structure.

9 Painting the dressNow it is time to finally start working on the witch’s 
flowing dress. At first I follow the lines of the drawing to stay 
within the established rhythm. Then I gradually erase the 
drawing on top, as I try to find ways to introduce more realistic 
folds and wrinkles into the larger shapes.

make a list
When you approach the 
final stages of a painting,
make a list of what
elements you still need
to work on (the left hand,
hair or skin texture, say)
and sort it into order of
importance. Then
complete each item on
that list one after the
other. You’ll avoid
getting lost in rendering
unnecessary detail and
your painting will be 
finished in good time. 10 Layering in the backgroundI haven’t touched the background since the early sketch 

stages. Now I work from back to front, adding trees and foliage 
layer by layer. These elements gradually become darker as they 
move closer to the viewer. To maintain an overall sense of depth 
in the scene, even the darkest trees in the background are still 
brighter than the foreground.

14 Finishing upI make the witch glow more by painting a bright saturated 
turquoise around the edges on a layer set to Overlay mode. I also 
detail the armour some more and soften some edges all around 
the image. And that’s it – the painting’s complete. Hope you like 
how it turned out! 

13 Foreground detailWith the help of some layers set to Overlay mode, I darken and saturate some parts of 
the painting. Then I proceed to gradually pick out detail within the foliage. This process is 
very relaxing and I could keep at it for hours, but I’m careful not to render these less-
important areas too much, in case they draw too much attention to themselves. I also add 
some colour variations to both the background and foreground.

11 Detailing the armourGoing back to the armour, I create some decorative ornaments on another layer to add 
more detail. However, I quickly discard this idea, since it does not work well with the cleaner 
lines of the armour design so far. Instead, I go with the previously introduced grooves and 
play around with different arrangements until I find something that looks good to me.

12 Foreground foliageI start defining some of the leaf shapes in the foreground 
and add some blades of grass in between. I also use different 
foliage brushes to give myself a base to work from. I make sure to 
stay within the established value groups so the details won’t 
interfere with the overall image.

Layer Docker
Some artists prefer to create paintings 
where each one of many layers has a 
specific purpose (line art, colour, shading, 
lights and so forth). To do this it’s important 
to know how to name, position, clone and 
delete layers, and how to use Opacity and 
Blending modes.

your advantage as katarzyna oleska explains the basics 

1 Paint layer vs  Vector layer
Some tools used on Paint and Vector 
layers will behave differently. On a Paint 
layer the Rectangle, Ellipse and Polygon 
tool shapes will be painted by a pre-
selected brush, while on a Vector layer 
they’ll become vector objects that you can 
select using the Shape editing tool and 
alter their shapes with the Path editing 
tool, as well as choose different outlines 
and fills (via the Tool Options docker).

2 Blending modes  and Opacity
Blending modes are grouped into 
categories in a drop-down menu in the 
Layers Docker (D). The top category 
(Favorites) shows all the blending modes 
that are checked in all the remaining 
categories. You can also use Opacity to 
control the layers. By experimenting  
with both of those variables you can 
create many interesting effects, and  
speed up your painting process.

3 Adjusting layersIf you select Layer from the top  
bar, a really useful drop-down menu  
will appear. Using that, you can rotate  
the layer, scale it, mirror it horizontally  
or vertically, merge layers with each  
other and even rasterise them. You also 
have the option to flatten the whole 
image. Similar options for you will  
appear if you select a layer from the  
Layer Docker and then click it with the 
right mouse button. 

In Krita Desktop you can create many 
different types of layers (Painting, Group, 
Vector, Filter, Fill and File), but the most 
important one is the Painting layer. 

In between the layers you can change 
the way they affect each other by 
assigning a blending mode for each one  
of the layers. You can also group layers 
and turn them on or off, either one at a 
time or as a group. Let me explain more…

ayers are a useful way of 
painting faster and more 
efficiently (you can find 
them via Settings>Dockers> 

Layers from the top menu). They also 
provide flexibility and enable you to 
control elements of your painting, 
together with the way they interact with 
each other. Layers are one of the key 
benefits of painting digitally. 

GettinG famiLiar 
with Layers

a. Blending modes
Blending modes enable you to control  
how layers affect each other. Normal is  
the default option, but there are many  
other choices for you: Multiply, Lighten, 
Saturation, Color and so on. The best way to 
find out how they work is to experiment, and 
observe their effects in action.

B. opacity
You can control the Opacity of a layer 
simply by moving the slider from left  
(0 per cent) to right (100 per cent).

c. managing layers
You can change layer names and see a short 
preview of what they contain by hovering 
over them. With the icons to the right you 
can make layers invisible, lock them for 
editing, or lock the Alpha (transparency).

D. cloning layers
Here you can create a new layer from a 
drop-down menu or clone the existing 
selected one.

e. Positioning layers
You can move an existing layer up and  
down the hierarchy, or move layers out or 
into groups of layers and also adjust the 
layer properties.

f. Deleting layer(s)
To delete one layer or many layers 
simultaneously, select them (to select 
multiple layers use Ctrl+click for choosing 
one by one, or Shift+click if choosing range 
of layers) and press the Bin icon.

As a high-level conceptual design,  
the main focus of this artwork was to

Fortunately, it didn’t take us too long

Using filters
I flip and transform part of the image, and 
change the Blending mode (usually Overlay), 
then use the Smudge and Displacement filters to 
create the reflection. I use boat illustrations, 
which I did earlier, to save time. I also review the  
perspective, luminosity and contrast so they 
blend in well. The reflections are lower in terms 
of luminance, compared to the light source.

Light emphasis
I place the moon behind Evie to push the 
silhouette and give it a romantic feel. The light 
direction creates planes of light and shadows 
that help emphasise the focal points. Local 
lights in areas of shadow generate interesting 
value variations and tertiary points of interest.

How i create…

a moon-LiT Scene in HiSToricaL London

1  Produce a rough sketchThis sketch was chosen because it had the most 
potential to deliver the atmosphere and lighting we 
wanted to see. The challenge here was the lack of height 
variation in the surrounding buildings, which made it 
hard to show depth. Flipping is always a good way to 
check if a composition is balanced. 

3  Painting the detailsI tweak almost everything. I change Evie’s pose, 
the height of the Tower of London and the surrounding 
buildings to refine the composition. To create depth,  
I play with the smoke and fog to create more layers and 
add a crowd in the distance to show scale. I always try to 
maintain the values that I’ve established in my sketches.

2  Blocking in the scene I use photos to create a base for painting later, 
paying attention to hue and value (check your values in 
greyscale using a black layer set to Saturation mode).  
I keep different planes on separate layers, so I can easily 
tweak them when necessary. Adjustment layers and 
clipping mask can be very useful here.

storytelling tips 
for comic books
lewis larosa talks about how to interpret scripts and lay out pages  
to emphasise the action and enhance the narrative…

he comic book artist’s job is to 
visualise the writer’s script in 
the clearest way possible. If 
comics were films, the artist 

would direct, shoot, act, design the 
costumes, make the props and do the 
VFX. The amount of control you have 
over the book is really very exciting. 

Comics aren’t TV programmes or films, 
and have their own storytelling tools. It’s 
amazing how much the shape, size and 

order of the panels affect the narrative. 
Layout alone plays a crucial part in 
moving the reader’s eye, the pacing and 
rhythm of the action, the importance of 
certain story beats, and whether or not a 
scene is peaceful, full of dramatic tension, 
or dominated by crazy action. 

There’s no one right way to interpret a 
script and visually tell a story other than 
to make it easily readable, as engaging as 
possible, and true to the writer’s intent.

Collaborating with your writer and editor 
– and even your inker and colourist – can 
really be beneficial by not only making 
sure everyone’s on the same page, but for 
bouncing ideas around.

Using Bloodshot issue 25 as an 
example, I’m going to guide you through 
the different layout and camera angle 
techniques a comic artist uses to pace the 
storyline, highlighting the action and the 
emotion along the way.

2 Relative panel size
Maximise the size of the most important panel on the 
page to increase its impact. The second panel on  
page 12 of the issue, where Stalker Dog soldiers fire 
away at Bloodshot, was easy to identify in the script as 
the most exciting panel on that page, so it was drawn 
to dominate the page. The first panel and last panel are 
reduced to quick before and after cuts.

1 pacing techniques
The first three panels on page 11 of Bloodshot 25 are all 
the same size, shape, on the same row, and are 
relatively small compared to the big fourth panel 
where the Stalker Dog soldiers burst into the room and 
attack the main characters. Those first three panels 
were all about building up to the fourth explosive 
panel. Tension and release.

 It’s amazing how much the  
shape, size and order of the  
panels affect the narrative… 

4 panel shapes
I love using odd panel shapes, but only to give the storytelling impact. As a 
rule, I only use them to heighten excitement, particularly in action scenes. 
Care should be taken so that the storytelling remains clear, arranging the 
panels so they flow into each other instead of confusing the reader. 
Compare these two pages: one of them is a talking heads page with 
traditional, straightforward panel shapes and arrangement, reinforcing 
that this is a relatively quiet, mundane scene. The calm before the storm. 
The other is an action page full of odd-shaped panels that convey a sense 
of chaos while still clearly directing the reader’s eye across the page. Be 
sure the shape of the panel complements the composition within. 

3 money shots
Let’s jump back to pages two and 
three of Bloodshot 25, written by the 
legendary Peter Milligan. They were 
written as a double page title spread 
meant to introduce our hero in 
action. I’m paraphrasing, but the 
script for the large, main panel reads, 
“Bloodshot in the middle of a 
firestorm in Aleppo, Syria. Bombs 
explode around him. A number of 
dead fighters and ruined hardware at 
his feet.” I went with a full body shot, 

making sure his trademark red chest 
circle was clearly visible, with his 
military armament and ability to take 
punishment (he’s getting shot in the 
shoulder). I chose a low angle 
(horizon line around his knees) to 
make him imposing and larger than 
life. He’s charging and firing as if he’s 
about to trample the reader and leap 
off the page. Tilting the camera 
makes it dynamic and enhances the 
frenetic feel of the scene.

6 the poweR of symmetRy
On both these pages, I’ve used symmetry in the panel 
arrangement and in the composition of the first two panels 
to help get across an orderly, sterile feel to the sci-fi lab 
setting. The mood is calm and quiet, and the heavy use of 
blacks gives a sense of foreboding. 

5 Quick cuts
Panel four on this page is 
what I refer to as a ‘quick 
cut’: a small, quick, 
transitional panel that I 
often draw overlapping the 
two panels it connects. Its 
small size and vertical 
orientation imply that the 
action within takes place in 
an instant – the eye’s not 
meant to linger here.

 Breaking 
borders should 
only be done to 
enhance impact 
and aid the 
storytelling 

Workshops

December 201576



For sketching and breakdowns I use a 
leadholder with an HB lead. Hold the 
pencil as far away from the tip as 
possible for faster, looser lines, choking 
up on it only for the fine details.

A leadholder sharpener. Gotta have one. 

Kneaded erasers can change shape, 
don’t tear up the paper, don’t leave 
behind eraser bits, and they can be  
used to either completely erase or just 
lighten up pencil work.

Microns are wonderful for the way they 
respond to the paper. I usually use an 03 
and an 005 for all my rendering and a  
1 to fill in larger black areas. Some 
whiteout is handy – I prefer whiteout 
pens. Pentouch is fairly transparent 
while DecoColor is pretty opaque. I like 
having both options for corrections, 
highlights, effects and so on.

tools
Lewis recommends the right 
art supplies for the job…

7 breaking borders
Like anything else, breaking borders 
should only be done to enhance 
impact and aid the flow of panel to 
panel storytelling. This page shows a 
dream-like sequence written by Peter 
Milligan where the character sees his 
wife floating above him moments 
before he dies. There are some rules  
I follow when breaking borders. First, 
border breaks should follow the rules 
of foreground/background/
middleground. Used correctly, this 
can create a sort of 3D movie effect. 
I wanted the wife in panel three to 
break borders, but since she’s in the 

middleground I had to have the head 
in the foreground at the bottom pop 
out of the panel. Second, objects 
breaking borders should only spill 
over into consecutive panels. Here, 
the character’s helmet in panel one 
leads the eye right to panel two, the 
wife’s hair takes us from panel two 
down her legs pointing at the soldier 
at the bottom of panel three, and her 
left elbow leads to panel four. If you 
break the border, break a whole lot 
of it! If it’s half-assed, the effect will 
be weak and it’ll look like you simply 
ran out of room. Be bold!

8 go with the z-flow
Direct the reader’s eye in a Z-pattern across the 
page, left to right, then down right to left, and 
left to right again. This page uses quick cut 
panels to enhance the Z reading pattern.

3  worked-up illustrationThe thumbnail is enlarged and traced onto the 
illustration board with a lightbox. I decided to have  
the soldier’s head explode through the border in the  
first panel, to give the kick maximum impact. I also 
placed the female character in front of the borders on  
the last panel to keep the foreground/middleground/
background consistent, since I had the male character 
behind her break the border. 

2  thumbnail layoutSmall layouts, or thumbnails, are drawn in sets of 
four on sheets of 8x11-inch typing paper I’ve quartered  
to the proportions of the final drawing board. After 
studying the sketches I made on the script page,  
I meditate and visualise the best angles to ‘shoot’ each 
scene, floating the camera around the action in my head, 
and decide how to arrange the panels in the most 
dynamic and readable way possible.

1  panel by panel sketchesI print out the script and roughly sketch out the 
action in each scene as plainly as possible right on the 
page. Nothing fancy. No crazy angles. This is a great way 
to work out poses, spatial relationships, and the 
progression of action from panel to panel. 

from script to illustration board
Lewis takes the writer’s draft of a page in Bloodshot and turns it into fully rendered artwork

10 acting aids
A good visual storyteller is adept at 
conveying character intent and 
emotions through their acting. Pay 
attention to body language and 
facial expressions. Be careful, 
though. There’s a fine balance 
between being too dramatic and 
unintentionally comical, and too 
dull or flat. A full-length mirror set 
up next to your drawing desk, a 
hand mirror, and a digital camera 
are essential aids for capturing the 
right gesture and expression. 

9 Zooming in  
and out again
This page depicts an 
intimate scene between 
two characters. I opted  
to go with a simple grid 
panel layout and kept the 
camera position relatively 
stationary, instead creating 
visual interest and 
enhancing the drama by 
zooming in and out on the 
action inside the borders.

11 Battle damage
In an action/adventure comic book, there’s bound to be copious 
amounts of damage done to characters and their environments. 
Keeping track of the progression of damage from panel to panel and 
page to page gives added weight to the consequences of the 
violence taking place. A real sense of danger and, again, believability 
is created in the storytelling. 

 Progressing the damage done 
from panel to panel adds weight to 
the consequences of the violence 

12 static vs  
moving camera
Page 15 of Bloodshot has 
two distinct scenes. The 
first is full of action (two 
panels depicting a heavily 
wounded Bloodshot 
gunning down a Stalker 
Dog soldier before finally 
collapsing). The second 
scene is relatively quiet. His 
wife cradles him in her 
arms. For the action scene, 
I kept the camera position 
relatively static to better 
emphasise the before and 
after action in this very 
busy scene. The static 
camera position makes the 
between-the-panels action 
nice and clear. For the 
second scene, since 
Bloodshot and his wife are 
being still, I was free to 
move the camera around 
to focus on each of their 
facial expressions.

Artist insight Comic storytelling

14 vertical vs horiZontal
Vertical panels portray shorter passages in 
time and tense moments; horizontal ones 
stretch out for open, relaxed moments. This 
page uses smaller vertical panels at the top to 
illustrate a quick, tense exchange between a 
villainous general and an insubordinate lackey. 
At the bottom, two big, wide horizontal panels 
are used to illustrate a relaxed scene of 
Bloodshot and his wife in a meadow. 

13 consistency in 
staging youR scene
Much of the action in this issue 
takes place in a kitchen. It was 
important that the layout of the 
kitchen was drawn up prior to 
choreographing the action for the 
sake of consistency and therefore 
believability. The big window door 
the Stalker Dogs burst through, the 
table Bloodshot and his wife were 
sitting at, the refrigerator, the stove, 
the door, the locations of the 
characters and so on were all kept 
consistent throughout.

 Constantly review 
the layouts to make 
sure there’s not a 
sameness from  
page to page 

15 shake things up
Variety is key to comic book 
storytelling. Vary panel sizes, 
shapes, camera angles, use of 
blacks, compositions and figure size 
as much as possible within the 
script’s parameters. Constantly step 
back and review the layouts to 
make sure there’s not a sameness 
from page to page. Comic book 
visuals should be dynamic and 
change throughout the book to 
reflect the story’s tone, atmosphere, 
locations and action.

your layers
If you work with lots of
layers, organise them
using folders. Take 
time to name them 
clearly. This will save 
time in the long run.

s a traditional illustrator I look 
on software as a tool – a 
powerful one that offers 
countless possibilities in 

comparison to traditional media. The 
main advantage is simplicity of use and 
the option to undo mistakes at any 
moment without the fear of ruining your 
illustration. It’s simpler than oil, 
watercolour or acrylic paints, because you 
can step back. The only problem is 
knowing when to stop.

Like any medium, there are traps. You 
can easily lose yourself in useless details 
and quickly bury your idea. You have 
much more control over several aspects of 
painting, including the composition and 
what your picture is telling you, which are 
by far the most important points, before 
dealing with the detail.

In Photoshop, I have reduced the 
selection of tools I use. My settings are 
quite simple. Even though I have lots of 
brushes I usually use five of them and the

Smudge tool, which I prefer to the  
Mixer Brush tool. I use masks, selections 
and gradients a lot and, of course, 
blending modes. I save often and 
regularly flatten my layers to keep the 
software running properly.

Recreating Hellboy, I’ll approach the

1 Find the ideaHellboy has a lot of personality. To set the mood, I sketch 
him in various poses from different angles. I doodle a lot, so  
I always have my notebook and sheets of paper near me, helping 
me quickly draw initial ideas for illustrations – digital or 
traditional. This time, around 10 or so little sketches give me 
enough to turn around an idea.

2 Composition and cleaningA good picture tells a story. This is the starting point. 
Colour, light and atmosphere all help, but the drawing and 
composition are the base of your structure, so don’t neglect 
them. I clean up the paper sketch, then I scan it at 300dpi.  
Next, I fix a few imperfections in Photoshop.

3D software
If you use 3D software
such as ZBrush, make a 
quick model based on
your drawing to give it 
volume. You’ll be able 
to choose your lighting 
angle and then see how 
your digital painting will 
be illuminated! 

4 The primerI paint with a soft textured brush. I use it as I would a 
primer in traditional painting. It’s still rough, but this step helps 
me to give more volume to the main lines of the face and to 
seriously think about the light. I start to visualise where I want to 
go with the colours, lighting and overall mood.

7 Starting to detailI use different textured brushes on the cloth and gun and 
work on the ammunition belt and the soft incandescence of the 
cigar. I start to detail the skulls and choose to stay in blue-purple 
hues so as not to draw too much attention to them. I often use 
the Smudge tool, with the tool preset to a brush by Sam Nielson, 
which makes it simple to mix colours.

6 Defining the lightNow my values are darker and I’m feeling the character 
more. I add detail to the skin and set the angle of the main light, 
which is top right. I paint an area of reflected light on the skin  
by following the colour defined in my shadowed areas and 
lightening its value. In this step I’ve used the Chalkwet brush a 
lot, for a gouache texture.

5 The right moodOn a new layer, I paint over him with a blue-purple 
gradient, softly saturated, with Multiply set to 40 per cent to 
strengthen the silhouette. I duplicate the layer and change the 
mode to Overlay at 45 per cent. On a third layer I add a yellow 
gradient, in Subtract mode, which removes the yellow from my 
channels and helps create a nocturnal mood.

3 Colour massesI focus on the character and start blocking in colours by 
making selections with the Lasso tool. I often fill areas with a 
gradient, because it quickly gives the idea of volume and 
diversifies the colour palette. Usually it takes me about an hour 
to find the right hues. Here things are simpler: Hellboy already 
has a colour scheme. It’s mine to play with.

8 Adding backgroundI add a simple background and at the same time flatten 
most of my layers. I keep working on the character, adding more 
subtle details. Going online, I find some reference images of 
leather and metal. The darker the background, the more startling 
the effect. This is convenient for the reflections on the metal, too.

experiment
Take risks in Photoshop, 
try many ways, modes 
and hues. That’s its great 
power – and you can still 
undo anything that 
doesn’t suit you. 

10 Cleaning upTime to clean him up. I sharpen the face and gun on a flattened layer using a mask.  
I add flames on a dark background, shifted with Liquify, then turn on Screen mode to detail 
his head. So it doesn’t seem too regular, I apply a soft textured background, with Multiply at 
13 per cent. Above this layer I add a radial gradient to give it some depth.

14 Final stepsFinally, I check that the dimensions of the picture fit the 
demands of the client and I return to the background to 
desaturate the skulls’ colour with the Blending Mode Hue.  
I decide to use some elements from an older version, like the tail 
and few details of the silhouette that I lost along the way. After 
one final review, Hellboy is ready. 

9 Natural brush workI use Photoshop as if I was painting with gouache. I like 
using the pressure on my stylus, barely modifying the opacity, 
but I vary the flow, to give my brush strokes a more natural feel.  
Using the Lighten and Soft Light blending modes, I give detail to 
the metal areas. I’ve tried a version with full horns, but I’m 
unconvinced and return to the sawed-off Hellboy.

13 Warming it upI boost the silhouette effect and look for the best effect for 
the skin texture, without falling into the trap of overworking it 
again. To make the colours vibrate a bit, I add a turquoise-blue 
layer, with Overlay at four per cent, and above it a dark blue layer 
in Exclusion mode. It warms up the picture and leaves a soft, 
smoky film in the background.

11 Background interestTime to look at the background. Similar to when I blocked 
in the colours at the beginning of my painting process, I trace a 
few tentacles with the Lasso to add some story. Then I convert to 
greyscale to check if my values are correct. I keep adding detail to 
the picture, referring to earlier steps to make sure I don’t miss 
something interesting.

12 Take a step backAt last I pinpoint what was bothering me. By overworking some details, the face has 
lost its strength and been softened. To correct this, I work on the lines of the nose, the mouth 
and cheekbones in a snappier way and soften the Sharpen effect. Stepping back like this is 
necessary to restore the punchiness of the first draft.

Painter 2016
Fresh Paint We investigate the new features Corel has introduced 
to see if this already capable painting software is worth investing in

ainter has been around for  
a long time, with a loyal 
fanbase and a mature, fully 
packed feature set. This 

means it already does pretty much 
everything that the majority of digital 
artists need it to, from excellent 
traditional brush reproduction and 
simulation, to beautifully rendered 
paper texture and a lot more. That 
makes it harder for the developers  
to find new tools and features – but 
Corel has managed to do this with 
some success for the 2016 edition. 

The biggest new feature in 2016 is 
Dynamic Speckles, which is truly a 
fantastic tool, especially for those 
artists looking to add a touch of natural 

P
chaos to a piece, or want to add variety 
to a repetitive area, such as foliage, hair  
or detail in rock. 

At initial glance, the new brushes 
look and feel a bit like a preset 2D 
particles system. But when you dig 
deeper into the brush settings you 
have a lot of control over every aspect, 
from colour variation to jitter, size, 
opacity and most elements of a brush 
that need fine tuning. 

What’s nice is that the brushes are 
quick to define, enabling you to work at 
a creative pace, rather than being held 
back by button pushing and menu 
surfing. The rendered results are lovely: 
variations look natural, without the 
forced pattern look you might expect.

If there’s one new feature that feels 
slightly out of place however, it’s the 
introduction of the Audio Expression 
tool. In essence, this means you can 
load in an audio file and Painter will 
then use the waveforms to control 
attributes of your stroke. While having 
some music on while painting is 
favoured by many, the transition from 
background to canvas doesn’t feel 
altogether natural. Although the 
strokes are unmistakably varied,  
it’s hard to see how the music is 
controlling the results.

Modern software for artists needs to 
be versatile, powerful and able to fit  
into a user’s workflow, as seamlessly as 
possible. Previous versions of Painter

think of them working

Can you tell us your background 
as an artist and Painter user?
I’ve been using Painter for the past 
few years. I started off in Photoshop 
back in the early 90s with a very 
small beige drawing tablet and 
while I still use Photoshop and  
my trusty Wacom every day, the 
technology has come a long way.  
I chose to explore Painter because  
it was a dedicated painting package 
with hundreds of unique brushes.

What’s your favourite feature  
in Painter 2016?
The introduction of the Dynamic 
Speckles Brushes. These were 
radically different to what had 
come before and immensely 
helpful to my fantasy art. I couldn’t 
wish for a better set of brushes.

Can you tell us a little about  
your workflow?
I’m a fully digital artist these days.  
I might do an initial thumbnail 
sketch on a notepad while on 
Skype with a client, but that’s really 
about it. Everything else is done 
digitally with my Wacom Cintiq 
27QHD Touch – an absolutely 
wonderful tablet that I simply 
couldn’t live without.

What’s so special about the 
combination of your chosen 
hardware and software?
I could never go back to another 
tablet or monitor, especially as 
Painter has so many functions  
that demand the sensitivity and 
accuracy of the Wacom.

What’s the key to successful art?
For me, an image is about telling a 
story. It’s one of the reasons I love 
painting book covers. Adding in 
those details embellishes the story 
beyond the obvious or enriches the 
character, and help gain potential 
readers. It’s a great way to add extra 
value for my clients and bring  
a cover to life. I also have a 
background in marketing, so  
I know the importance of making 
your audience turn the cover! 

have been pretty good at giving you 
the choice of where to dock palettes 
and GUI elements, and this new release 
adds to this with a useful new custom 
toolbox system. While not breaking 
any real new ground, what Painter 
does allow for is palettes of mixed 
items. So if you’re a particularly 
focused artist who tends to only use  
a small handful of tools, you could 
gather them into one palette, keeping 
your workspace clear.

2016 is a solid release for Painter  
that brings a number of new features 
to the artist. Yet it’s the more subtle 
enhancements that make it a 
worthwhile purchase. The custom 
toolbox is great and, along with the 
new Photoshop brush import option, 
does help to make an artist’s life easier.

While the other new features are a 
mixed bag, none of them detract from  
a great painting program, and some 
help it stand out. 

 Dynamic Speckles is truly a fantastic 
tool, especially for those artists looking 
to add a touch of natural chaos

articleShop is a promising 
program, with a lot of 
potential. It’s an official 
plug-in for Photoshop  

made by Corel (also compatible with 
Adobe Lightroom, Corel PHOTO-
PAINT and PaintShop Pro) that offers 
a starter range of 11 brushes powered 
by Painter’s Particle brush 
technology, making them technically 
more impressive than anything 
supplied by Adobe. Each brush in the 
starter pack gives an example of the 
11 additional brush packs (including 
flame, light, smoke, hair, space and 
debris) available for purchase.

Running ParticleShop launches the 
program in its own window rather than 
inside Photoshop. But the user 
interface feels very similar and it’ll only 
take you a few moments to acclimatise 
to the controls. The brushes are 
described as photorealistic, which is 
indulging in hyperbole a touch, but 
they are genuinely impressive and 
considerably more advanced than 
your usual Photoshop custom brushes. 
The aurora borealis effect brush will 
have you painting the Northern lights 
in minutes. A lot of the light effect 

brushes are lovely, and will enhance 
photographs and illustrations to give 
them a fantastical feel. However, 
despite being gorgeous brushes, they 
do have some unfortunate limitations 
that detract from the overall product. 

Most disappointingly, there’s no 
Layer functionality within ParticleShop, 
so you’ll need to make a copy of your 
original photo or painting because 

you’ll be painting directly on to it! 
Alternatively, you could make a new 
layer on top of the image in Photoshop 
before running the plug-in, but you’ll be 
painting effects on to a transparent 
layer with no original layer underneath 
to use as a reference point. When the 
file is back in Photoshop, you could 
transform the effects into place, but 
this seems counter-productive. 

P
ParticleShop’s brushes are effect 

brushes, intended to supplement and 
enhance an image rather than create 
one from scratch. If you think about 
print adverts where athletes are hurling 
flaming basketballs while leaving 
energy trails, then this is the sort of 
look ParticleShop would not only make 
easy, but excel at. Futuristic landscape 
concepts would also be augmented 
well with ParticleShop.

So do we recommend you purchase 
ParticleShop? Sadly, not yet. With 
further development, ParticleShop 
could find itself in the must buy 
category. But for that it would need  
the addition of layer support, some 
stabilisation so the plug-in doesn’t 
cause Photoshop to crash when other 
apps are running simultaneously  
(we had to turn off Spotify to get 
ParticleShop to load correctly) and  
a more reasonable pricing structure 
(currently if you want the entire set of 
ParticleShop brushes you’d be looking 
at paying over £300). But right now, 
despite its numerous excellent brushes 
on offer, ParticleShop needs more 
versatility and stability to earn its 
current price tag. 

 The aurora 
borealis brush will 
have you painting 
the Northern lights 
in minutes

ParticleShop
PartiCle PoWer! Corel’s new plug-in brings its impressive Particle 
brush technology to Photoshop. But are its limitations too severe?

The impressive realism of ParticleShop’s 
effect brushes means you can add dust, 
shine and general chaos to your scenes.

Dramatic-looking backgrounds, such as nebulas 
and the aurora borealis, can be quickly rustled up 
with ParticleShop’s brushes.

Once you install the plug-in, it won’t take long to 
enhance your landscape paintings by adding sci-fi 
elements – such as this interdimensional rift.

Artist profile

James 
Gurney

James specialises in painting 
realistic images of scenes that can’t 
be photographed, from dinosaurs 
to ancient civilisations. He’s also  
a plein air painter and sketcher, 
believing that making studies from 
observation fuels his imagination. 
James taught himself to draw by 
reading books about Norman 
Rockwell and Howard Pyle. He 
received a degree in anthropology 
at the University of California, but 

chose a career in art. 
James has written the 
instruction books 
Imaginative Realism, 
and Color and Light.

www.gurneyjourney.blogspot.com

Everything is presented in a relaxed 
manner and with the high production 
values it makes the video a delight to 
watch. It’s so pleasing on the eyes and 
ears you don’t realise how much you’re 
learning, which goes far beyond the 
technicalities of gouache.

As he paints the neon sign, for 
example, James talks about the 
difference in colour temperature 
between areas in sunlight and areas in 
shadow, and how he adapts the hues 
to communicate it. This study reflects  
a broader theme in the video of how  
to deal with light that’s changing faster 
than you can paint. For the fixed sign, 
James comes back the next day to 
finish the picture. In a rural location, he 
anticipates how the scene will broadly 
look after the sun has set, so that he 
can focus on important details when 
the relevant moment arrives.

If you’re keen to raise your own work 
to a higher standard, this hour-and-a-
quarter with a master of the craft will 
set you on the right track. 

MASTER AT WORK Painter and illustrator James Gurney shares  
some of the skills that help him create brilliant paintings on location

ames Gurney is famed for 
paintings that show either 
imaginary or, in the case of 
his dinosaur pictures, long-

since-vanished phenomena. This 
second video from his In The Wild 
series (following Watercolour In The 
Wild, reviewed in issue 115) 
showcases one of the key techniques 
James employs to make the fantastic 
appear so real in his work. Put simply, 
he takes every opportunity he can to 
paint outdoors, observing and 
recording the world around him.

James shows here why gouache  
is his preferred medium for certain 
situations and locations. Its facility for 
laying down flat colour, for example, 
makes it a natural choice for rendering 
man-made objects like the neon sign 
he finds during one visit. The video 
alternates between teaching sessions 
that discuss the basics such as 
materials and core methods, and on-
location films showing James tackling 
a variety of different subjects.

J

Gouache In The Wild

Other media such as coloured pencils 
combine well with gouache, as James 
captures the detail in this gas station scene. 

As he paints a neon 
shop sign, James 
uses his experience  
to get a solid result 
despite the 
ever-changing light.

This rural scene needs a lot of 
preparation, but this frees up 
James’ limited time at sunset  

to capture important detail.

Authors Guy Coulson & John Avon  Publisher John Avon Art Ltd  Price £40  Web www.johnavonart.com  Available Now

King’s Dark Towers series, where his 
mastery of combining acrylic and 
airbrush blend atmospheric lighting 
with solid, believable characters 
inhabiting a fantastical landscape.

Or you can start with his continuing 
relationship with Magic: The Gathering 
which began in 1996, where the 
themes of balance that run throughout 
his career are still in attendance. By the 
time we get halfway through the book 
– signifying the introduction of pixels 
into the Avon equation – this balancing 
act is still at play, whether it’s light and 
dark, dominant complementary hues, 
or grand structures that dwarf intrepid 
explorers within the composition.

That’s not to say that the bedrock of 
John’s work is focused entirely on 
contrasts. His ability to imbue narrative 
within a sparse scene is breathtaking. 
Even his simple landscape paintings 
always seem to have some cue that 
invites exploration and suggests the 
beginning of a narrative.

PAinting PilgrimAge If you want your art adventure to be 
long one, then study the footsteps of this fantasy art giant…

here are countless things 
you can learn from 
studying an artist’s body 
of work, especially one 

whose career spans 30 years. In that 
time a commercial artist needs to 
remain relevant or perish, while 
simultaneously holding on to 
something that defines them as 
unique among their peers. 

Doing this (and doing it well) is 
something John Avon knows a lot 
about. Thanks to Journeys to 
Somewhere Else he now reveals his 
personal passage with us – warts, 
screaming leaves, floating cities and all.

Back in June 2014 the Kickstarter 
campaign to make this book was 
launched and surpassed its goal in a 
short space of time, such is the 
appreciation for the artist’s work. 
Indeed, it’s fairly easy to become a fan 
of John’s art. You can begin in the late 
80s and early 90s with iconic book 
cover designs like those for Stephen 

t

The Art of John Avon: 
Journeys to Somewhere Else

This artwork appears as 
a gatefold in the book. 
John tried hard to make 
all five landscapes work 
as a whole.

John reveals that he felt the pressure of creating 
artwork for Stephen King’s The Dark Tower series. 

So there’s a lot here that any aspiring 
artist or illustrator can learn from – the 
majority of which is imparted through 
captions that accompany each 
painting. In a single paragraph a strong 
personal connection to John’s process 
or thinking at the time is established. 
The result is you can navigate John’s 
career with him as a guide. It’s an 
opportunity not to be missed.

Dare2Draw
Leaping into superhero central, NYC, we catch up with CharLes D CheNet to talk 
about his revolutionary comic book drawing group inspired by the Will eisner studio

Steve Rude “the Dude” shares 
some tips, as he does an oil 
painting demo, during an 
event held at the Art Students 
League of New York.

C
harles D Chenet started 
Dare2Draw five years ago, 
following his resignation 
from the US Air Force. He 
put everything on the line, 

including his pension, to start something 
he believed in and he wished had been 
available to him: an affordable mentoring 
process for comic artists. 

Charles began by building a studio  
in Harlem, New York. “I wanted to use  
a proven model of hard work and 
commitment, like the classic 
apprenticeship studios along the lines of 
the Will Eisner Studio,” he says. 
“Technology continues to make it easier 
for people to produce their own content 
and put it out there, which has created a 

platform for a lot of voices but very few 
choruses. The only unified voice seems to 
be coming from large corporations, 
making it even harder for independent 
talent to be recognised and discovered.” 

Since Charles saw no union or real 
representation for artists, he felt 
companies were pitching artists against 
each other – creating a competitive and 
unhealthy space. “There’s a perpetual 
treadmill for any working artist, with a 
line behind them of freshly graduated art 
students, trying to get the same jobs.” So 
Charles created a proving ground for 
artists where professionals can be easily 
reached. The pro artists can give back to 
their community while newcomers gain 
invaluable contacts and tips. 

“Art students and aspiring cartoonists 
can get together, learn something and get 
some cool, new art supplies from our 
sponsors,” says Charles. His five-year 
journey, to boldly go where no cartoonist 
has gone before, has been for him, “a 
glorious trek… bringing the events from 
bars and convention rooms to different 
art organisations. We’re currently 
producing a TV show, seeing amazing 
talent with some truly awesome 
mentoring artists sharing tips and stories 
of their own journeys – exciting times!” 

 
Charles is the founder of 
Dare2Draw, a non-profit 
mentoring platform for all 
artists. He still serves in the  

Air Force Reserves. www.dare2draw.org

F
or this workshop, I’ll be 
painting a ferret with a flagon. 
The composition will have an 
outdoors setting with an early 
European feel. The challenges 

will be to render fur, armour, wet wood, 
ceramic, glass, and brick, all in a jolly 
outdoor pub setting! 

My influences on this piece are 15th 
century Flemish tavern paintings and 
19th century French master Jean-Louis-
Ernest Meissonier and in particular, his 
painting The Card Players. I often look to 
the painters of the past for ideas.

I want to paint a happy chap, and 
because it’ll be a single character image, 
have him addressing the viewer, to share 
in his happiness with his frothy beverage. 

That settled, the look and anatomy of 
ferrets begin to dictate the design of the 
piece. Ferrets are long bodied and stubby 

nosed, with short arms and legs, so it’ll be 
fun to break up the slinky body with 
armour and clothing that at the same 
time show off his long, wiggly body. 

The challenge will be to evoke a 
traditional drinking portrait, but with fun 
and whimsy. The attitude of the drinker  
is crucial, so initially I don’t put much 
consideration into the colour palette, 
because warm, earth tones should work 
well. However, as you’ll see, simple earth 
tones can quickly become a dance of 
balancing warms and colds, yellows and 
reds, against blues and cool browns. 

The light is an outdoor, al fresco 
atmosphere, made possible by the gloom 
of the shadows. The light quality will be 
dictated by textures, metal, wood, cloth 
and so on. By exploring these qualities I’ll 
inadvertently be painting the sunnier 
side, as shadow describes light.

I also consider how the feret sits in the 
scene. A tall, thin, wiggly figure will need 
some kind of support, aside from the 
table. Early on in the painting process, the 
building architecture with a window 
comes in as suitably strong geometry 
against which to play the animal’s 
drunken movement, while the barrel acts 
as a weight and wedge to hold the lower 
half of the subject in place. 

The fun of entering a ‘simple’ single 
subject is a great opportunity to focus on 
the complex power every seemingly 
simple element exerts on the whole.

LOST AND FOUND

Watercolour on a well-

sized paper has the 

flexibility of being able 

to remove or push 

around pigment. Lay 

down a wet line and 

you can dab it out or 

scrub it back and forth, 

trying various line 

positions and ideas, 

picking the strongest 

and pushing back the 

wrong answers. But 

beware: too much 

reworking on wet paper 

will munch up the 

surface and may give  

unwanted textures.

4 A second colour
Once I’m sure that the line work captures the essential elements I’m after,  

I redraw into areas that I’m happy with, using darker and cooler earth tones

3 Compose as I go
I turn the ferret’s head to the left, bouncing off the 

flagon on the right, where it becomes the anchor. I follow 
the flow to the ground, where I find the need to draw a dirk 
(sword) set at 45 degrees, to both counterbalance the 
swoop of the torso and mirror the angle of the head.

1 The sketch
I tend not to do thumbnails, but go after the initial 

feel and flavour that come to mind. This usually expresses 
itself as a simple gesture that I quickly and lightly scratch in 
pencil. In this case, because I don’t have a strong picture in 
my head, I lay down lines that suggest several possibilities.

2 Draw with a brush
Next, after staring into the scribble with the initial 

sense of the image in mind, I decide to draw my ferret in 
watercolour using warm, light ochers. This is not the same 
as painting, mind!

5 Blue is the colour
It’s now time to explore the volume of the 

subject, by defining the structure with a blue, cold 
counterweight. Note that just because parts are in 
shadow, it doesn’t make them ‘heavy’ compositional 
elements. This stage could be seen as feeling out the 
edges of my mid-tones.

109December 2015

10 Final colour decision
As the piece gains weight and colour, the trousers 

call out to be red, because of the blue/green shutter, warm 
brown flagon, down to blue/cool armour, next to the cool 
colours under the table. So the pantaloons need to be a 
warm colour. See how things are cool, warm, cool, warm?

9 Composing with tones
The balance in the scene comes from between the head and the flagon, but 

also the swoop of the body, especially the armoured belly off-setting the rump that’s 
holding up the head, capped with the cap. But to keep it from becoming too heavy  
on the left, I need the flagon to carry the whole right of the composition, so the weight 
of the shutter becomes important. The flagon is stacked on the belly, pushed up by 
the legs and then lifted up by the shutters.

8 Start building weight
Now that all the elements are in place, it’s time to build up weight and balance.  

I look for where the darker, heavier notes will be and start laying in washes and 
rendering out to the final image. In this case, it’s the lower third of the painting, in 
particular the barrel and under the table.

6 Bringing in paint techniques
As I move forward, the drawing starts to utilise 

painting techniques inherent in the brush. Textural 
considerations call for more expressive brush handling:  
dry brush scrapping for brick; splotch and scumble for 
stone; and float wet on wet for metal.

7 Defining the colour palette
Once I have warm lines and cool shadows, I decide 

on colours within the scene. With the cool armour set 
against a warm brick wall, I opt for a red cap. The ferret is 
already in warm earth tones, so this red can be easily shifted 
later on to either very warm or low key cool.

FINDING THE 
SUBJECT

Once you’ve settled on 

the general idea for a 

painting it’s important 

to internalise what I 

call its flavour: the 

atmosphere or feel of 

the initial concept. 

This will ensure that 

subsequent painting 

choices stay true to 

your initial vision as 

you strengthen the 

composition.

KNOW YOUR PAPER

Watercolour papers 

have a front and a back, 

referred to as their 

weave/felt print. That 

is to say, texture is 

different from one side 

to the other. In addition, 

the sizing of the paper 

is usually dominant on 

one side compared

to the other, so be 

aware that using either 

the front or the back 

of the sheet can 

dramatically affect 

performance.
15 Rinse and repeat

As washes darken the piece, the underdrawing 
becomes softener. So I need to do a spot of redrawing, 
picking out the main anchor points of the ferret’s gesture 
and anatomy. This also has the double effect of introducing 
a final layer of detail to the painting. 

11 Red? Time to introduce green!
With the red bottom comes the contrast with green. 

The wet on wet floating of greens and yellows are wedged 
into the barrel shadow behind the red. This intersection of 
colour and shapes is very important because it serves as 
the foundation for the ferret’s facial gesture.

12 Polish the painting
Using a dry brush, I weave colour and 

texture over and into the lower washes and the 
drawing. At this point, using pure pigment enables 
colour mixing to happen optically on the paper.

13 Balance with washes
I counter the built-up weight of the drybrushing with 

glazing light washes of cool/warm tones to the background 
supports. This has the effect of knocking out pure whites  
so that selective whites on the main figure pop.

14 Low-tech Photoshop
Here’s a tip if you have any doubts about your values. If you go dark with 

watercolour, it’s hard to go back to light, so I shade in with pencil to see the effect.  
Just like in Photoshop, this enables me to shift the values back and forth until I’m sure 
on how to proceed. Then I erase the graphite and paint my tones to the desired value.

111December 2015

BRUSH
TIP

Not just for oil
Use an old hog hair 
brush for any deep 

scrubbing out, to either 
burn out or kick back 

a value, or soften  
a texture.

design and draw  
a fantastical beast

Fantasy creature design is essentially breaking down real animal forms and 
combining them to make something new, as Brynn Metheney explains

MaterialS

Graffwood pencil

n Staedtler rubber 

eraser

n Acid-free sketchbook 

paper

C
reature design is built on 
the foundation of 
understanding real-life 
animals. Even when we 
design fantastical creatures 

like dragons or demons, pulling from 
nature can help make it more believable.  

First, I explore the animals themselves. 
Drawing each species helps me get to 
know their anatomy. I take note of certain 
traits, proportions, markings and shapes 
as I draw. Then I find a shape inspired by 
one of the animals, which acts as a 

foundation for where I’d like to go. I use a 
harder pencil lead to keep things light and 
workable. I’m only concerned with getting 
down big shapes, like the shape of the 
head and general body and tail. 

Studying how certain animals carry 
themselves will help you pose your 
creature. I’m looking to the tapir and 
spiny tailed lizard. I find a stance between 
these two animals and tweak it to make 
sure it looks natural. I sketch out the rest 
of the animal to find the landmarks, such 
as the shoulders, knees and the rib cage, 

using boxes and planar shapes to help 
flesh out the creature. 

Now I add detail and other shapes, 
looking at the secretary bird. Claws, 
spikes, scales, fur and feathers help to 
flesh out its silhouette. It’s important to 
make it iconic. Having too much detail or 
“stuff” happening on your creature could 
dilute the effectiveness of your design.

1 Find the general shape
As usual, I start light, and keep in mind the characteristics I want to combine. I’m always asking 

myself questions. What does this creature eat? How big is this creature? What is its general attitude? Is it 
male or female? Addressing these areas can help direct your design.

2 Build up forms
Next, I begin to lie in big forms.  

I want to find the anatomy of this 
creature. Because my beast has a 
skeleton, I’m careful to take note of 
where certain bones and landmarks 
are. I indicate key elements like the 
shoulder blades, the pelvis and the  
rib cage. These large forms will help 
me indicate where the muscles lie and 
help build a more believable creature.

3 Nail the muscles
From here, I begin to define muscle groups, being sure to 

understand where certain muscles are connecting. This is vital and is 
informed by producing lots of animal drawing. It’s important to know 
where muscles lie on your creatures for animation and modelling. Being 
able to show and tell where and how your creature moves is crucial when 
creating a grounded creature design.

4 Look at those details
Next, I begin to define certain details and shapes, always being 

careful to look at my reference. Here I’ll begin to look at the tapir for the 
bulk of the body and the feet. The spiny tailed lizard helps with the tail, 
head and texture of the creature. I also look to the secretary bird for ideas 
about feather placement, eye placement and eventually colour.

5 Now, really look at  those details!
As you draw those tapirs, you notice 
that each toe has a different shape and 
that the front legs have more toes. 
You’ll notice the shape of the secretary 
bird’s eyelids and the way the skim 
folds on the face. These small details 
can really push your creature design 
into the realm of believability.

Col-ErasE
Waxy lead

Take advantage of the 
Col-Erase pencil. Because
it’s waxy, it takes a while

to solidify forms, and
this lends itself to 

exploration. 

Here, I switch to my graphite pencil 
and draw over my blue lines. This 
enables me to indicate the details 
and forms I want to show.

Note things like battle damage, markings 
and folds of the skin. All of these factors 
can help sell the design.

When I draw in a new body feature, I’m careful to start 
with a lighter touch. As I build up my creature, I push 
down harder on my lead.

Remember that vertebrate anatomy is similar between 
species. You can think of your own body as a reference point.

It’s good to add and take away. Now is the time to 
experiment with shapes and features.

Keep the shapes big and light at this point. Think  
about where the muscles would attach to the bone.

Artist insight Creature design



Where did you grow  
up, and when did you 
realise you had a talent 
for painting?
I grew up in Daytona 

Beach, FL, surrounded by mullets, 
NASCAR, motorcycles, Catholic school, 
rock and rap. My parents opened an art 
supply store when I was a year old, and I 
started drawing at two (so they tell me).  
I used mostly pencils and markers – not 
a whole lot of painting until much later.

Did your upbringing influence your 
style of painting?
I didn’t try to paint seriously until high 
school. I became obsessed with Alex 
Ross’s art, who probably had the biggest 
influence on me, stylistically. But I was in 
love with comics and cartoons as well, so 
it was a pretty broad spectrum. My mom 
did framing and sold posters at the store, 
so I was surrounded by more classical 
influences as well. With her degree in 
textiles, she made sure I had some 
understanding of colour theory and 
design (and ample Halloween costumes). 
My dad, who currently inks my work, 
would probably have liked to be a fine 
artist, but airbrushed to pay the bills.

Did you naturally gravitate towards  
the comics industry?
There was never really any other option 
for me. We were about an hour away 
from Disney World, so people would 
always ask if I would work for them when 
I grew up. Although I had no intention, 
fate had other plans for me. My dad 
scared me away from animation (tons of 
work, not enough glory) but didn’t scare 
me enough to keep me away from 
pencilling (tons of work, glory to match).

How has the field of comics changed 
since your time in the industry?
I consider myself very lucky when it 
comes to timing. I had the benefit of the 
internet to get me a job, but the field 
wasn’t so crowded, especially when it 

came to comic book painters. Nowadays, 
it’s never been easier to get your work out 
there – and because of that, the 
competition has never been higher.  
I started at Marvel a year before I 
graduated from art school. I’d like to 
think I could still break in now on my 
own merit, but I think it would’ve taken 
much, much longer. But aside from some 

very surface-level technological 
advances, the fundamentals haven’t 
changed. The best part is uploading art 
instead of mailing it. I can resend a 
corrupted file, but there’s one Doctor 
Doom painting that I’ll never get back.

What’s been the highlight of your career 
so far? Any low points?
It’s pretty tough to beat the whole 
experience of being on Daredevil. The 
whole team was amazing, I got to work 
with my dad, and we all got a ton of 
recognition for just doing our job. I’ve 
had great experiences since then, but 
that was a perfect storm (the good kind). 
No low points… yet!

What’s been your most challenging 
commission or assignment?
I’d have to say my first issue of Spider-
Man (Spectacular #14 with Paul 
Jenkins). I’ve done more technically 
demanding work since, but at the time, 
that was the hardest I’d ever worked for 
an extended period of time. I can count 
on one hand the number of times I went 
outside during that three-and-a-half 
month period. I stopped shaving, 
stopped showering and survived on 
Oreo cookies. I also got fat. “A bit roly 
poly,” as my editor later told me.

How regularly do you produce  
your sculptures?
Not enough! The last real sculpt I did 
was my wedding cake topper back in 
2013. Prior to that, I did a Mary Jane 
maquette in 2010. Now I seem to only 
do digital maquettes, and they’re never 
very detailed – just enough to get the 
proportions right as a drawing reference.

What advice would you give to your 
younger self?
“Just wait. You’ll find the girl of your 
dreams. Here’s her address.” Actually, 
maybe that’s a bad idea. Professionally 
speaking, I’d tell myself to concentrate 
on drawing rather than painting… but  
I probably wouldn’t listen.

How would you sum up your work,  
in under 10 words?
I’d like to think the best is yet to come.
