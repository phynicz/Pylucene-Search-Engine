Loyd Grossman

Benjamin West’s life is a

rags to riches story worthy

of a novel, which also

illuminates some of

the key artistic and

intellectual trends of the

18th century.

� Loyd discusses the great
Georgian artist Benjamin
West on page 44

Ryan Lavelle

I’ve been fascinated by the

Anglo Saxons’ defence

against and accommoda

tion with Viking invaders.

This was a time when

people’s identities could

be shaped according to

circumstances, and the

Anglo Saxons saw and

dealt with Vikings as more 

than just pagan foes.

� Ryan explores Anglo-
Saxon England on page 22

Alison Weir

Recently I have been

exploring the story of a

royal intriguer who

dabbled perilously in

Tudor politics at the

courts of Henry VIII and

Elizabeth I. She’s largely

forgotten now, however, so

I’ve been working to

retrieve a feisty lady

from obscurity.

� Alison traces Margaret
Douglas’s life on page 60

A major new BBC historical drama, The Last Kingdom, is

due to hit our screens in the next few weeks. The eight-

part series is based on novels by Bernard Cornwell and

will take viewers into the world of late ninth-century England when

the country was divided between the Vikings and the Anglo-Sax-

ons. Historian Ryan Lavelle has acted as a consultant for the series

and for this month’s cover feature (page 22) he explores the complex

relationship between the Norse invaders and those who sought to

repel them, most notably Alfred the Great . As Ryan explains,

diplomacy was just as important as warfare when it came to 

Anglo-Saxon survival.

Britain’s most recent battle for survival occurred in the Second

World War, when facing the march of Nazi Germany. This conflict

was fought on land, sea and air but also in the shadows, as Max

Hastings reveals in his survey of the ‘secret war’ of spies, code-

breakers and deceptions. Turn to page 50 to find out more about

some of the war’s most extraordinary individuuals.

Max is one of almost 40 historians to be speaaking

at our upcoming Malmesbury History Weekeend ,

alongside the likes of Joann Fletcher, Sam Willlis,

Loyd Grossman, Alison Weir, Dominic Sandbrook

and Michael Wood all of whom have also wriitten

for this edition of the magazine. I look forward to

meeting many of you at the event and, even if you’re 

not able to attend, I hope you will enjoy these

authors’ contributions in the pages that follow.

ANNIVERSARIES
25 November 1120

Henry I’s heir  
drowns at sea

William Ætheling finds “his grave
in the bellies of fishes” off the

coast of Normandy

23 November 1963

The Doctor steps inside the  
Tardis for the very first time

An unpromising BBC schedule-filler takes its first strides  
towards becoming a British cultural institution 

On the morning of 25 November 1120, William Ætheling, son and 
heir of England’s king Henry I, was in 
the prime of life. He and his father were 
in Barfleur, Normandy, preparing to 
return to England, when they were 
approached by sea captain Thomas 
FitzStephen. “Stephen, my father, served 
yours all his life by sea, and he it was who 
steered the ship in which your father 
sailed for the conquest of England,” said 
Thomas. “Sire king, I beg you to grant 
me the same office… I have a vessel 
called the White Ship, well equipped and 
manned with 50 skilful mariners.”

Henry had made other arrangements. 
But William fancied a trip home on a fast 
new ship. Alas, he also liked a drink. By 
the time the clerics arrived to bless the 
ship, William and his friends were 
already the worse for wear. So were many 
of the crew, whom the prince had 
encouraged to join them. By the time the 
ship left, it was packed with some 300 
people – many of them roaring drunk.

What followed was one of the worst 
disasters in the history of the English 
monarchy. The White Ship had barely left 
port when it hit a rock and began to sink. 
William managed to escape in a small 
boat, but when he turned back to rescue 
his half-sister Matilda, other survivors 
crowded abroad and the boat promptly 
capsized. “The head which should have 
worn a crown of gold,” wrote the 
chronicler Henry of Huntingdon, “was 
rudely dashed against the rocks; instead 
of wearing embroidered robes, he floated 
naked in the waves; and instead of 
ascending a lofty throne, he found his 
grave in the bellies of fishes at the bottom 
of the sea.”

S ettling down before the television in the early evening of 23 November 
1963, few people could have imagined 
they were about to witness the start of a 
British cultural institution. Indeed, 
many were still in shock at the news from 
across the Atlantic, where, a day earlier, 
John F Kennedy had been shot dead in 
Dallas, Texas.

Even as its unearthly title music filled 
the air, few knew what to expect from 
Doctor Who. The Radio Times had billed 
the programme as “an adventure in 
space and time”, explaining that its 
heroes might find themselves in “a 
distant galaxy where civilisation has 
been devastated by the blast of a neutron 
bomb or they may find themselves 
journeying to far Cathay in the caravan 

of Marco Polo”. Yet most of the first 
episode was set in a contemporary 
London secondary school. Indeed, the 
programme itself had unpromising 
origins, having been designed as a 
schedule-filler to follow Grandstand.

Later, the BBC’s audience research 
report began with the verdict of a “retired 
naval officer” who described the show as 
a “cross between Wells’ Time Machine 
and a space-age Old Curiosity Shop, with 
a touch of Mack Sennett comedy”. It was, 
he told the BBC, “in the grand style of 
the old pre-talkie films to see a dear  
old police box being hurtled through 
space and landing on Mars or some-
where. I almost expected to see a batch  
of Keystone Cops emerge on to the 
Martian landscape.”

10 November 1793

Paris echoes to the Festival
of Reason

The altar-smashing and looting of the French Revolution  
gives way to a celebration of the human spirit

P aris, 10 November 1793. Inside  the cathedral of Notre Dame, an 
astonishing spectacle is about to unfold.

For months, reports from across 
France had spoken of gangs breaking 
into churches, demolishing altars and 
looting the treasuries. Revolution against 
the monarchy had escalated into 
revolution against authority itself; to 
many of the political radicals who had 
seized power in Paris, Christianity 
represented the supreme enemy. By 

mid-1793, many had pledged allegiance 
to the new Cult of Reason, born of the 
Enlightenment and devoted to the 
human spirit. As one radical agitator put 
it, there was now “one God only – the 
people”.

On 10 November, the anti-religious 
movement reached its climax. Under  
the direction of radical writers Jacques 
Rene Hébert and Antoine-Francois 
Momoro, churches across France were 
stripped of their remaining Christian 

trappings and rededicated as Temples of 
Reason. At Notre Dame, the most 
famous church in the land, activists tore 
down the altar and replaced it with a 
mock hill, topped with a round Greek 
temple. On the top were carved the 
words ‘To Philosophy’, while inside the 
temple burned a torch of truth.

Spectators watched in astonishment as 
two lines of torch-bearing girls proceed-
ed down the nave, past hastily erected 
busts of Voltaire, Rousseau and other 
Enlightenment thinkers, bowing 
solemnly before the so-called altar of 
Liberty. As in cities across France, a 
scantily clad woman in Roman dress 
played the part of the Goddess of Reason. 
The Parisian version, played by Mo-
moro’s wife, was generally thought the 
best – although, as Thomas Carlyle 
rather ungallantly remarked, “her teeth 
were a little defective”.

Spectators gape at the mock hill and Greek temple in the cathedral of Notre Dame during the Festival of Reason,  
in an image from 1793. In the foreground, the ‘flame of truth’ burns brightly

London’s Royal Society was the
most important scientific invention

of the 17th century. The first of its kind, it
was soon imitated in cities all over Europe.

Previously, natural philosophers had met 
privately to discuss why things happen. In
contrast, the new experimental investiga-
tors banded together to make things
happen. By creating scientific societies,
they made knowledge public and acquired 
the collective influence they lacked as
individuals. By promoting the advantages
of scientific research, these societies
attracted government investment and were 
celebrated as major contributors to the
booming industrial economy. By the 19th

century, scientific societies had put  
science into society. 

The greatest hero of the early Royal 
Society was Francis Bacon, the former lord 
chancellor who had laid down guiding 
principles for scientific enquiry in the early 
17th century. Inspired by him, the Fellows 
aimed to collect observations, establish 
scientific laws, and use their new-found 
knowledge for technological inventions that 
would benefit the nation. 

Membership was restricted to those men 
(not women!) who could afford the fees, 
and the society reached a large effective 
membership through its journals, which 
provided detailed reports of the latest 

experiments and observations. Spreading 
knowledge through print became a 
fundamental component of 
scientific activity.

The oldest scientific academy in continuous existence was born in 
an age of extraordinary turbulence. It 
was during the mid-1640s, with England
convulsed by war and revolution, that a 
group of ‘natural philosophers’ began 
meeting informally to discuss their 
ideas. Within a few years, two groups 
had formed, one in Oxford, the other in 
London. For the best part of a decade, 
the London group met at Gresham 
College in Holborn. But when the army 
occupied their rooms during the anarchy 
that followed Oliver Cromwell’s death in 
1658, meetings were suspended.

It was only after the restoration of 
Charles II two years later, which brought 
order to the capital, that the natural 
philosophers felt safe to resume their 
deliberations. On 28 November 1660, 
Christopher Wren was due to give an 

astronomy lecture at Gresham College. 
Afterwards, a group of 12 men, including 
Wren, piled into the rooms of Gresham 
professor Lawrence Rooke. They were a 
mixed bunch: astronomers, mathemati-
cians, physicians and inventors. Some 
were parliamentarians; others had links 
with the royal court. What united them, 
though, was a commitment to science.

That evening, as the 12 men discussed 
Wren’s lecture, they also debated their 
journal – later named ‘A Designe of 
Founding a Colledge for the Promoting 

of Physicall-Mathematicall Experimen-
tall Learning’. According to the journal, 
they agreed to meet every Wednesday at 
3pm, with an initial membership fee of 
10 shillings and a regular fee of a shilling 
a week. Seven days later, at the next 
meeting, royalist intellectual Sir Robert 
Moray reported that no less a person 
than “the king had been acquainted with 
the design of this meeting. And he did 
well approve of it, and would be ready to 
give encouragement to it.” The Royal 
Society was up and running.

King Charles II – depicted here in his role as patron of the Royal Society  
– took a lively interest in science

From Tigger to the trenches:
EH Shepard’s war drawings revealed

Newly rediscovered work by

the Winnie-the-Pooh illustrator

offers fresh insights into the

hardships and humour of the

First World War. By Matt Elton

H
e is most famous for his illustra-
tions for Winnie-the-Pooh, AA
Milne’s popular series of children’s

books. Yet EH Shepard did far more than
draw what he came to regard as “that silly
old bear”: he also created an array of work
from the First World War, an archive of
which has just been compiled.

The images, one of which is exclusively
reproduced above, have never been publicly

available before. They were created while
Shepard was serving at the Somme, Arras
and Passchendaele, and depict daily life for
British soldiers in the Great War. While
they show the style familiar from Shepard’s
children’s books, they more closely reflect
the political and social sketches he regarded
as his main strength.

“Much coverage of the war has inevitably
been about the enormous casualties, but 

Work in progress
A previously unseen
illustration by EH Shepard

“Shepard depicts a scene
that could be on any parade
ground – but he somehow
communicates the anxiety
and innocence of the
new recruits,” says James
Campbell, author of
a new book displaying the
illustrator’s wartime work

Shepard shows us behind the scenes,
into both the domestic and personal,
and also the aftermath – sometimes
poignant and sometimes humorous,”
says James Campbell, the curator of
a new book featuring the illustrator’s
drawings and letters. “He often looks at
the lighter side of the war, gently mocking
well-known national stereotypes.”

The fact that the illustrations were
split between a number of institutions,
including the University of Surrey, meant
that the full extent of the collection had
not previously been known. They often
take the form of unfinished sketches,
and together reveal more about Shepard’s
life and career. Having already worked
on illustrated editions of books includ-
ing Aesop’s Fables, he served as an army
officer from 1915 until the end of the war
– continuing to send back work for the
satirical magazine Punch while he did so.

“These war illustrations act as a
bridge between Shepard’s early work
and the later maturity of his images for
Winnie-the-Pooh,” says Campbell. “They

demonstrate an increasing confidence
and economy of line that nonetheless 
conjures up life and movement –
something that he was to exploit
so successfully in his later animal
drawings.”

As with many men of his generation,
however, Shepard also had a tragic
personal connection to the war. Letters
included in the new collection relate
the death of his brother, Cyril, who was
killed on the first day of the battle of the
Somme on 1 July 1916. “This material
offers a very personal view of the war,
from the tragedy of Shepard’s brother’s
death to the humour of cartoons teasing
the Germans and the British ‘Tommy’
alike,” says Campbell. “The incredible
range of his talent, from technical
drawings to cartoons and sketches,
shows the highs and lows of this conflict.”
Shepard’s War has just been published 

by LOM Art. An accompanying  

exhibition runs at House of Illustration

in London until 10 January 2016:  

houseofillustration.org.uk

“Shepard shows
us behind the scenes 
of the war, into
both the domestic
and the personal”

Battle lines One of Shepard’s war illustrations, dating from 1916. In the caption, the officer
enquires: “So you want me to read your girl’s letter to you?” The soldier replies: “Sure, sir,
and as it’s rather private, will you please stuff some cotton wool in yer ears while ye read it?”

ory stories of people who under-
went operations in the days before

anaesthetic understandably feature
heavily in our impression of historical
medicine. Yet new research is exploring
the other side of the story – how surgeons
dealt with the prospect of causing pain.

The study, being led by Michael Brown
from the University of Roehampton
and funded by the Wellcome Trust, will
draw on official documents and personal
records to discover surgeons’ thoughts
and emotions, as well as the relationships
that they established with their patients.
It also aims to challenge the emphasis
on ‘clinical detachment’ that previous
studies have ascribed to medical experts.

“Surgeons’ overarching emotions,
it seems to me, were fear and sympathy,”
says Brown. “Very few got to perform
a major operation before they qualified,
and naturally most were anxious at the
prospect. Despite the common percep-

days before pain relief? A new study aims to find out

tion of surgeons as emotionally detached,
many also felt – or at least claimed to
feel – deeply sympathetic towards their
patients in most instances. They often
spoke about managing their patients’
emotional states, determining if they
were capable of withstanding the rigours
of the procedure and the pain and suffer-
ing that they would experience.”

Brown will also explore what the
experiences of these surgeons may be able
to tell us about 21st-century medicine.
“The transition offered by anaesthetic,
from operating on conscious patients
who could feel every movement of the
knife to operating on those who were
more or less unconscious, was utterly
transformative,” he says. “I don’t intend
to lecture surgeons about being more
compassionate. But I do think that this 
research will enable them to think in
different ways about their own emotional 
relationships with patients.” ME

Debate rages over ‘Nazi 

gold train’ discovery
Two men who claim they have found
a Nazi train laden with gold in Poland
say they have “irrefutable evidence”
of its existence, despite so far failing
to publicly substantiate the claim.
Local legend says that a train filled
with gold, guns and gems went
missing near the city of Walbrzych in
late 1944 or 1945, but officials have
cast doubt on stories of its discovery.
The Polish military is now thought to
be investigating the potential site.

A ‘ritual arena’ has been

found near Stonehenge
The remains of a huge stone
monument have been discovered
by archaeologists working two
miles from the site of Stonehenge
in Wiltshire. The series of between
90 and 100 standing stones are
thought to be 4,500 years old and
formed a C-shaped ‘arena’ directly
facing the river Avon. Researchers
used ground-penetrating radar to
reveal evidence of the stones, some
of which would have measured up  
to 4.5 metres tall.

city of Palmyra, satellite images
confirm. The militants captured the
Temple of Bel, a Unesco World
Heritage site, in May, and a huge
explosion was reported in the area
late in August. As well as the temple
– seen as one of the most important
religious buildings of the period –
a line of nearby columns is also
now known to have been destroyed.

Alongside
the history

of British hospitality,
there is also the long-
established practice
of governments
closing the door
DAVID FELDMAN

To what extent can Britain and Germany’s responses to  

the current migrant crisis be explained by similar episodes  

in the past? Two historians offer their perspectives

Interviews by Chris Bowlby, a BBC journalist specialising in history

As they confront the desperate attempts of 
undocumented migrants to enter Europe, 
both the Conservative government and its 
critics agree on one thing: namely, that 
Britain has a noble tradition of welcoming 
refugees. The prime minister says the 
government is living up to this tradition; 
critics say it is being betrayed. 

As they justify their positions, both sides 
invoke a pageant of victimised peoples who 
have made their home here: from Huguenots 
in the 16th and 17th centuries to political 
exiles, royalists and revolutionaries alike, in 
the 18th and 19th centuries; Jews fleeing 
tsarism before the First World War and Jews 
escaping the Nazi regime in the 1930s; 
followed by Hungarians, Ugandan Asians, 
Vietnamese, Kosovans and others in the 
decades after the Second World War. 

Yet there is another, different, story we 

could narrate. For alongside the history of 
hospitality and asylum there is also the long 
established practice of governments closing 
the door and failing to support those 
refugees who do make it into the country. 

One of these two stories – the one that 
presents Britain as a beacon of decency – has 
a secure place in public memory. The other 
is buried and forgotten. Yet a Janus-faced 
response to refugees is an abiding feature of 
British history over the last century.  

While more than half a million Jews 
sought refuge from Nazi persecution in 
Britain, just 80,000 were allowed into the 
country, with the intention that most would 
re-emigrate. The celebrated Kindertransport 
brought 7,482 children to this country but, 
unable to obtain visas, their parents perished. 
Ministers and officials feared that the Jewish 
refugees would never leave, would take 
British jobs, arouse anti-Semitism in Britain 
and become a charge on the public purse. 
This view of how a refugee crisis impinged 
on the national interest squeezed the space 
in which humanitarians could work. 

A similar tension arose three decades later 
when, on 4 August 1972, President Idi Amin 
announced the expulsion of 50,000 Ugan-
dans of Asian descent, the great majority of 
whom held British passports. Just one year 
earlier the Conservative government had 
passed the 1971 Immigration Act. This was 
the culmination of a decade of legislation 
enacted by Conservative and Labour 

governments designed to drastically reduce 
the entry to Britain of people of colour, even 
if they carried a British passport. Respond-
ing to Amin’s announcement, many in the 
Conservative party and some local authori-
ties protested that the country was full. 
Faced with a Powellite challenge, Edward 
Heath’s government agreed to accept a little 
more than half – just 27,000 – of the 
Ugandan Asians. 

Our selective recall plays a role as we 
confront the refugee crisis today. Refugee 
campaigners draw on the partial history of 
British humanitarianism as they try – with 
little success – to get the government to 
adopt a more benevolent policy. But the 
government itself insists its actions are in 
line with the nation’s best traditions. It has 
always been thus. Anthony Eden’s words, 
written in 1943, could equally provide the 
watchwords for ministers now: “We should 
avoid any reproach that we are not doing all 

we can to rescue these 
unfortunate people.”

Professor David Feldman  
is director of the Pears Institute 
for the Study of Antisemitism at 
Birkbeck, University of London

The historians’ view… 

How noble is  
Europe’s tradition 
of welcoming  
refugees?

The spectacular opening and panicked
closure of Germany’s borders in recent
weeks could be a metaphor for a migration
history that is more complex and ambivalent
than many imagine.

Germany under Kaiser Wilhelm II had
large Polish-speaking populations who were
regarded as Germans and Prussians – inte-
gration was organic. But when they moved
west to industrialising areas of the Ruhr, 
they became a ‘problem’. They spoke a
different language, they were Catholics
in largely Protestant areas, they had too
many children. Yet over the long haul they
developed their own political organisations,
and integrated themselves. RE

Eve Rosenhaft is professor of
German Historical Studies at

During the 1930s and 40s the Nazis
promoted the idea of the Auslandsdeutsche
– ethnic Germans all over the globe who
were seen as part of the greater Reich, to
be ‘brought home’ and reintegrated.

Ironically such a homecoming occurred
after the war when 12 million refugees –
mainly ethnic Germans – were expelled
from eastern territories as punishment for
Nazi aggression. Most settled in the new
West Germany, where they were integrated.

Having studied the worst of German
history, I retain a grudging respect for the
way in which West Germany (at least at the
official level) faced up to these challenges.

With later arrivals, the picture changes. As
the economy boomed, so-called Gastarbeiter
(‘guest-workers’) arrived from places like
Turkey and southern Europe. Their
reception confirmed that, in terms of
long-term German national identity, the
country still saw itself as kein Einwanderung-
sland (not a country of immigration).d

My own research into ‘black Germans’
reinforces this point. In the 1920s there was
a terrible backlash when France used African
troops to occupy the Rhineland. That
licensed a kind of colour-based racism on a
large scale. The ‘Rhineland children’ (born
from relationships between German women

and French African troops) became an icon
of German racism. And the vision of
Germany as a society of white people is still
deeply embedded today.

In the German response to the current
crisis we’ve again seen both sides of the story. 
Before the emergence of more public
sympathy in August, what dominated the
news was evidence of popular opposition.
There was violence against refugees and
hostile demonstrations. More recently we’ve 
seen the re-emergence of a tradition of
humanitarian engagement in Germany,
strong in the churches since 1945.

Demography also seems to be playing a
new role in German thinking. Germans are 
increasingly aware that the country’s
population is shrinking and it will need
more young people. For decades policy-
makers were too anxious about anti-immi-
grant feeling to suggest that new blood could
be ‘imported’, but something does now

seem to be shifting here.

n inquest was held in London for 
the death of a young man, Walter 

Cowle, who had previously been
employed as an envelope-cutter. On a
recent night out in Soho, Cowle had
visited the Carlisle Arms Tavern, on
Bateman Street, to meet with friends.

Some way into the evening the
conversation turned to tricks and feats
each could perform, and, perhaps on a
dare, Cowle claimed he had the ability 
to place a large billiard ball in his
mouth and close his teeth. His friends
were eager to see this trick performed,
and so the landlord was requested to
produce one – which he did after
several assurances that Cowle would
not actually put the ball in his mouth,
but would use sleight of hand to amuse
and trick the gathered company.

Unfortunately something went
wrong, and Cowle attempted to
swallow the ball, immediately choking.
There was little the collected crowd
could do. They held him upside down,
slapped his back, and tried to remove
the ball from his mouth, but nothing
worked and Cowle was soon pro-
nounced dead. A good friend of Cowle’s
insisted he had seen Cowle do the trick 
many times, and it had never gone
wrong before.

Choked by a 
billiard ball

Grantham Journal/ 
11 November 1893

When did public weather
forecasting begin in Britain?
In 1854 Britain’s Board of Trade
established its Meteorological
Department (today’s Met Office),
headed by former naval officer Robert
Fitzroy. Five years later, nearly 500
people drowned when the steam
clipper Royal Charter was wrecked inr
a storm off Anglesey. This led Fitzroy
to develop weather charts to allow
‘forecasts’, as he called them, to be
made to improve safety at sea.

In 1861, using data telegraphed
from 15 land stations across the UK,
Fitzroy produced the first daily
weather forecast in The Times, and,
that same year, he launched a gale

arning system for ships using a
ystem of cones which were hoisted 
t ports around Britain.

ow long have weather forecasts
een broadcast?
or more than a century. The Met
ffice broadcast its first forecasts via

adio in 1911. The BBC launched its
hipping Forecast in the mid-1920s. It
as become a cultural icon, featuring
rominently in the opening ceremony
f the 2012 Olympics. As the forecast
as to go out at a predictable time, 

listeners to Test Match Special on
long wave in 2011 famously missed
the climax of all three English victories
because each time the programme
had cut to the forecast.

When did weather forecasts
appear on our TVs?
The BBC transmitted its first weather
chart at the start of a trial series in
November 1936. BBC Television
closed down during the Second
World War but, in July 1949, it began
broadcasting weather maps with
captions again. On 11 January 1954,
it put out the first live weather forecast
from Lime Grove Studios in London.

Who was the first TV weatherman?
George Cowling made that first
five-minute broadcast. Armed with
pencils, a rubber and a pair of
dividers, he informed the viewers that
the following day would be a good
one to hang out washing. Subsequent
presenters have included Bert Foord,
Barbara Edwards, who became the
first female presenter in 1974,
Ian McCaskill and Michael Fish,
whose dismissal in 1987 of the
prospects of a hurricane has  
entered national folklore. 

As the Met Office digests the news that it has lost its

BBC weather forecasting contract, Julian Humphrys 

looks at the origins of a national obsession

LETTERS

I was pleased to see that you included
with Joel Greenberg’s recent article
about Alan Turing (Alan Turing: The
Man, The Enigma, October) a
photograph of the 16-year-old Alan

Turing taken in 1928 while at Sherborne
School. But I was sorry that no mention was
made of his time at the school.

The years Turing spent at Sherborne
School (1926–31) played an important part
in his later development. We can trace
Turing’s interest in cryptography directly
back to his school years. In 1928, Turing
borrowed a copy of Rouse Ball’s Mathemat-
ical Recreations and Essays from the school
library. The book includes a chapter on the
art of constructing cryptographs and
ciphers, stating: “Their usefulness on
certain occasions, especially in time of war,
is obvious, while it may be a matter of great
importance to those from whom the key is
concealed to discover it.”

Turing also studied German while at
Sherborne, although his German master’s
comments on his school report, “He does
not seem to have an aptitude for language”,
suggests that he wasn’t a natural linguist.
However, there is an interesting twist to this
story. During the Second World War, the 

same German
master worked in
military intelli-
gence and would
have seen many of
the Ultra messages
decoded by the
Turing machine,
although neither
would have
known that the
German master
was reading the
messages decoded by his former pupil.

When Turing left Sherborne, his
housemaster wrote to him saying: “I will
guarantee that Turing will be a household
word until the present generation has
disappeared.”

The shock of abolition

Matt Elton writes eloquently on the
shocking normality of the slave trade
(News, September). However, I believe
what was really shocking about slavery
was its abolition. Slavery had been an
accepted institution in human societies
for millennia – the ancient Greeks and
Romans had it, the contemporary
Ottomans and Persians had it, as did
virtually every civilised nation in
western Europe and the states of 
northern Africa (who supplied the raw
material to European slave traders).

Given that historical and contempo-
rary context, I can understand why we
indulged in slavery and the trade. Slavery
was an accepted and legally sanctioned
institution in the colonies (although not
in England, as proved by the court case
Somerset v Stewart in 1772). It took very
British notions of fairness, justice and

decency to work out, with no external 
pressure, that the trade was cruel,
immoral and wrong.

Banning the trade in 1807, followed by
abolition of the institution itself in 1833,
were actions that we took of our own
account. Yes, we should never have
instituted slavery in the empire in the
first place, but I am immensely proud of 
the role that we played in stopping it
(bearing in mind, particularly, that it
took a four-year civil war to do so in 
the United States). We should
also never forget the thou-
sands of British seamen who
gave their lives in the early
19th century off west
African shores, both to
disease and to combat,
in order to enforce the 
ban on the trade.

The relief of Hiroshima

I have just read your article on
Hiroshima (Should America Have
Dropped the Bomb?, August). My father
fought in the Indian army in Burma and
told us many stories of what they had to
endure. For these soldiers fighting in
jungle terrain in a monsoon and having
to endure foot-rot and having no access
to medical care – unable to light fires for
fear of detection and in some instances
unable to smoke or even talk – Hiro-
shima couldn’t come soon enough.

He was fortunate to miss the battle of
Imphal as he had been recalled to India
for a few days but had several friends
killed in that most ferocious battle
around a tennis court. The Indian army
then started pushing the Japanese back
down Burma and they had to repeat all
the horror of the retreat campaign again,
but this time with the upper hand.

Although we all regret the civilian
deaths at Hiroshima and again at
Nagasaki, for those Allied troops who
were on the ground it came as a massive
relief that there would be no more loss of
life there. We can argue as much as we
like over the point but we weren’t the
ones facing death every day. Hiroshima
was horrific but what price would our
troops have had to pay without it?
Louise Kelly, Johannesburg

Spitfire solution?

I have now discovered the following
information regarding the Spitfire
depicted on page 19 of your August issue
(Letters). Squadron code DV B was on a
mark 1X Spitfire which joined 129
(Mysore) squadron on 14 August 1943
and was destroyed on the ground in a
raid on RAF Hornchurch when with 504
squadron on 23 February 1944.
129 squadron moved from Tangmere to

Ibsley, Hampshire on 13 March
1943, to Hornchurch on 28 June

1943 and to Peterhead on 17
January 1944. It is likely
therefore that your picture
was taken at RAF
Hornchurch between
14 August 1943 and
17 January 1944.

votes for women in
2018. This book will be

A taste for crepes

Reading Mark Stoyle’s article about
Brittany (My Favourite Place, October)
brought back many happy memories of
holidays in Brittany when our children
were younger. We went from
Portsmouth to St Malo, with Brittany
Ferries, and were always impressed by
the start of the journey through
Portsmouth dockyard seeing all the
Royal Navy ships including HMS
Victory, the Sallyport and Southseay
Castle. It was a great start to any holiday.

However, I think Mark’s article was
missing one important ingredient:
crepes! Holidaying in Brittany intro-
duced us to crepes, which not only tasted
fabulous but allowed our children to

speak French and be understood: “Oeuf 
et Jambon crepes”!
Archie Whymark, Lancashire

Corrections
� As a couple of readers have spotted,
the caption for the image at the top of
page 26 in October’s issue (The Glorious
Caesars) incorrectly states that Livia was
the wife of Tiberius. She was in fact his
mother. There is also debate about
whether the figures shown are Tiberius
and Livia at all, as some believe this
might be a depiction of Claudius’s
brother and sister-in-law, Germanicus
and Agrippina the Elder.

Michael Wood on… the Labour party

I went to Featherstone the other day.
A small stop on the local line from
Pontefract to Wakefield, it was the scene
of dramatic events in the Great Miners’

Lockout of 1893. By the cemetery I stood where Keir
Hardie made his speech calling for the creation of a
Labour party, and I found myself musing on the party’s
history at this moment of what the commentators are
already calling “cataclysmic change”: the golden time of 
1945; Wilson’s four victories; the heady days of New
Labour; and now the travails of the last few years
culminating in doom-laden predictions of Labour’s 
demise. From Hardie to Corbyn, it has been an
extraordinary story.

For me it was a sentimental journey. My first job after
university was as a journalist in Leeds, and I went to
Featherstone a few times then, to watch the Rovers, and
in search of history. This was during the seventies pit
strikes, and it was a real baptism of fire. In the smoke-
filled bars of miners’ welfare clubs, there were very
different takes on history and politics. Here in Yorkshire, 
history was nothing if not real.

Featherstone is an ancient place (it’s in Domesday
Book). Coal has been mined here since at least the
13th century – there’s wasteland still pockmarked by
primitive bell pits. But it was transformed in the
mid-19th century when the pits were sunk to provide
coal for the factories and battleships of empire. One of
them, Ackton Hall, was owned by Samuel Lister, 1st
Baron Masham, and there, on 7 September 1893 during
the lockout of miners protesting for a living wage,
soldiers brought in by Masham shot and killed two men 
and wounded 16.

The ‘Featherstone Massacre’ became a byword in
Labour history. Among the speakers at the funerals was
Robert Cunninghame-Graham, Liberal MP, Scottish
socialist and founder of the SNP; and Robert Blatchford,
who published an inspiring account of the day in his
paper The Clarion, calling for the formation of a united
socialist party. Most of all, there was the greatest single 

figure in the creation of the Labour party, Keir Hardie.
Hardie had been elected to parliament the previous

year and had been instrumental in starting the Indepen-
dent Labour Party in January 1893. He was a lay
preacher, and it’s often said Labour owed more to
Methodism than to Marx. But though some (like
EP Thomson) have argued that its quietism inhibited
direct action, Hardie was anything but quiet. In a
brilliant, fiery speech he told the people of Featherstone 
that a national Labour party was now the priority.
It would come in 1900.

The story was never forgotten by working people.
Home secretary HH Asquith, even years later as prime
minister, would be heckled as the ‘Murderer of Feather-
stone’. One old man in Featherstone even told me that
it was Winston Churchill (another bogeyman because
of the General Strike) who gave the order to fire!

I heard the story not long into my job in Leeds and,
with more enthusiasm than skill, I made a film for
regional TV – my first. And that was how I came to meet
Nellie Alexander who, as an 11-year-old, had seen it all
from her little terraced house near the pit gates, spine-
tinglingly telling the tale over tea in her front room. Yet,
to my great chagrin, she refused to appear on camera
“for fear of bringing more trouble onto Featherstone!”

The film came and went, as films do. But a couple of
years later Featherstone School turned the story into a
play. I went along, and it was incredibly moving to see
the kids reliving their ancestors’ story.

Since then the village has experienced huge changes.
The pits have disappeared, first to go Ackton Hall after
the 1984 miners’ strike. On the centenary, a monument
was erected in the shopping precinct. But with coal gone,
it’s a new world now.

A new world for Labour too. The high noon of 1945,
when the nation was behind the blueprint for social
change, seems another age. So what happens in the next
chapter of the party’s story will be a real pointer to where
we stand today… and to whether history still has lessons 
to offer.

Anglo-Saxons vs Vikings

A
n early scene in the new
BBC TV series The Last
Kingdom sees the hero (or
anti-hero) Uhtred,
dispossessed claimant to
the Northumbrian fortress
of Bamburgh, entering the

city of Winchester for the first time. Uhtred
and his companion, both raised in a Danish
household and in many ways more habituated
to Danish customs than Anglo-Saxon ones,
gain rapid access to the royal court of Alfred
of Wessex. At the heart of the court, the pagan
Uhtred is granted an audience with the
Christian prince – and their discussions range
from knowledge of the world to military
strategies. From this, we get an insight into
Alfred’s relationship with Uhtred, how each 
sees the other – and, crucially, how each
intends to use the other.

Could such a scene have played out in
ninth-century Winchester? Why was a prince
of the West Saxons extending the hand of
friendship to a pagan – a Dane, no less – at
some point in the early 870s? The stereotypes
dictate that a Danish Viking was too intent on
pillaging to engage in any communication but
violence. Received opinion also has it that the
West Saxons were far too pious to accept
Scandinavians as anything but the scourge of
God, to be resisted by warriors and suffered 
by holy men.

Viking onslaught
In many ways, the West Saxons’ attempts to
defend their realm in the face of the Viking
onslaught – particularly under Alfred ‘the
Great’ in the final decades of the ninth
century – is a story of conflict, of battles and
stratagems, peace treaties made and broken,
and of military leaders straining for victory in
the direst of circumstances.

According to the Anglo-Saxon Chronicle
and Life of King Alfred – the West Saxons’ main
courtly products telling the story of these
years – that military leadership was provided
by Alfred himself. But no matter whether
Alfred can really be personally credited with
the successes of the West Saxon kingdom in
repelling the Viking threat, there is more to
the story than conflict and the imposition of a
West Saxon peace. Compromise, trust and
understanding between the two peoples – as
portrayed by the fictional Uhtred and Alfred
in The Last Kingdom – was also at the heart of
what it meant to be English in the 9th and
early 10th centuries.

Where early medieval ‘Englishness’ was
once regarded as binary – either you were
English or you weren’t – and the West Saxons’
defence against the Vikings was seen as a part
of the making of that Englishness, there is now

“To many religious writers, it must have

seemed that ‘Northmen’ did indeed herald
the apocalypse, but by the late ninth century 
these attitudes were beginning to change”

St Edmund is captured by
Danes in a c1130 illumina-
tion. His death in 869
would go down in infamy
yet, despite this, Vikings
and Anglo-Saxons would 
learn to co-operate  

room for a more nuanced story. The Vikings
who came to England in the ninth century
were woven into this story in a way that made
them so much more than the pagan ‘other’.

That is not to say that Danes did not
represent an existential threat to Anglo-Saxon
rulers and their kingdoms, particularly
Wessex. During the later part of the ninth
century, the West Saxon kingdom was defined
by its difference to the Danish-held territories
– and the need to defend themselves against 

the Danish threat drove much of the West
Saxons’ policy forward. The Danes launched
numerous attacks on Wessex, and the
kingdom itself was almost lost to at least one
well-organised incursion.

From the introduction of military service
to the building of ‘burhs’ (fortifications), the
character of the West Saxon kingdom was 
determined by a Scandinavian threat
outside it.

I have been a fan of Bernard Cornwell’s
books on early medieval England since my
student days, so it was a great pleasure –
and an honour – to work with Carnival
Films on The Last Kingdom, their adapta-
tion of his Saxon novels.

Cornwell often uses an outsider to tell a
story, like his famous Napoleonic creation,
the working-class British Army officer
Sharpe. In The Last Kingdom, it is the
Saxon Uhtred, whose Danish upbringing
creates a conflict of identity that propels
the storyline. It’s been fascinating to
witness the production developing as the
book’s first-person narrative and
biographical storyline has had to pick up a
pace for a series of TV episodes.

While I would love to take some credit
for that, my own role meant leaving the
storytelling to the experts, and simply
being available to respond when needed
to provide some costume advice, com-
ment on scripts, and make occasional set
visits. In many ways I became a historical
helpline, getting questions like “tell us how
a marriage would be arranged”, “what
could happen at a coronation?”, “how
should this name be spelt/pronounced
in Old English?”

To answer such questions meant putting
what I’ve learned about the early Middle

most often employed to describe the pirates
who exploded upon the western European
scene in the late eighth and early ninth
centuries was ‘Northmen’, a word that, while
(mostly) being more geographically accurate,
recalled the apocalyptic idea, trumpeted in
the Book of Jeremiah, that evil would come
from the north. To many religious writers, it
must have seemed that these ‘Northmen’
indeed did herald the end-time. But by the
late ninth century, we see fewer ‘Northmen’ in
Anglo-Saxon sources, as the term gave way to
‘Dane’. And the reason for this may lie in the
increasing representation of Vikings as people 
who you could do business with. 

Danes and Northmen
It seems that this was a meaningful distinc-
tion – and one that may have been reflected in
the pages of the Anglo-Saxon Chronicle. While
an early English text had labelled the
instigators of an attack on Dorset in c789 as
‘Northmen’, a later account of the very same
incident in the Chronicle refers to the
aggressors as ‘Danes’. It was perhaps a telling 
editorial modification.

This important, if tentative, change in
attitude was reflected in the growing number
of peace agreements that the two sides signed
in the late ninth century. The most important
of these was the ‘Alfred-Guthrum’ treaty,
sealed following Alfred’s 878 victory at the
battle of Ethandun (Edington, Wiltshire)
which shattered the Vikings’ ambition of
conquering Wessex . The surviving document 
that records Alfred’s triumph probably
represents a renegotiation of the territory
between the two leaders.

In many ways, this treaty recognised how
‘Danes’ and ‘Englishmen’ were separated and
subjected to different legal systems. However,
the fact that both groups were subject to the
same law – which was agreed by two sets of
leaders, “confirmed with oaths, for them-
selves and for their subjects, both for the
living and for the unborn” – created a sort of
unified identity that had not before existed in
the area that is now referred to as England.

That sense of peace was important. The 
Venerable Bede, the eighth-century
Northumbrian author of a work long
recognised as providing Alfred’s ‘blueprint’
for the idea of an Angelcynn (English realm),
had reported that an early Anglo-Saxon king,
Edwin, had provided the conditions in which
a woman could travel with a newborn child
from sea to sea without fear. Whether the
conditions in late ninth-century England
really allowed for such journeys is immaterial. 
Alfred’s allusion to those “unborn” might
have been intended with Bede’s sense
of peace in mind; a king who provided peace
for an Angelcynn was one who recognised 

Ages beyond rarefied academia into a
‘real’ world of creative imagination
populated by such real historical charac-
ters as Alfred ‘the Great’ (not always a
likeable fellow, it appears). I’ve had to
avoid the historian’s temptation to respond
to questions with a list of footnotes and
caveats leading into a range of other
possibilities based on the slimness of the
surviving evidence. That sort of thing cuts
no ice in a multi-million-pound production.

I quickly learned that, because what
happens in one version of the script can
change quickly – and change again a
dozen times before it is shot – clear and 
concise answers are essential.

I have also had to keep reminding
myself that The Last Kingdom is not a
historical documentary series. The
overriding principle has always been to
drive the story forward, but I’ve constantly 
had to think: “Is this possible – does it
work on screen?”

What the team came up with didn’t
always match my interpretation of
Anglo-Saxon history, but that usually
needs footnotes! However, the production
is a valid interpretation: it’s entertaining,
interesting and, for me as a historian of the
period, it’s thought-provoking. To that end, 
I couldn’t have asked for more.

Strathclyde
A Welsh (‘British’) kingdom whose
territory ranged across modern-day
Scotland and Cumbria in north-western
England, it was dealt a blow when
Dumbarton Rock was besieged by
Dublin Vikings in 870. With Govan (now
in Glasgow) as its likely religious centre,
Strathclyde still continued as a political
force well into the 10th century.

Cornwall
Cornwall was coming under the West
Saxons’ direct control in the ninth
century. At least some Cornishmen
resisted, including allying with Vikings
in 838. The death of the last known
Cornish king is recorded in a Welsh
annal in 875 but the survival of Celtic
place-names in Cornwall shows how
the old kingdom never became a full
part of the Anglo-Saxon world.

Welsh kingdoms
A range of kings with a variety of 
extents of power and layers of lordship 
appears to have been the order in early 
Wales, with Gwynedd in the north-west 
coming to the fore. Although Rhodri 
Mawr (‘the Great’) suffered at Viking 
and English hands, probably killed  
by Mercians in 878, his successors 
asserted dominance over many of the 
neighbouring kingdoms, making 
alliances with Vikings and Anglo-Sax-
ons according to circumstances.

Anglo-Saxons vs Vikings

‘Danes’ as potential subjects. There was 
precedent to be followed here, but it was not 
an English precedent. Instead it came from 
across the Channel, in the land of the Franks 
(roughly equivalent to modern-day France). 

Historians have largely debunked the old 
myth of there being a great chasm between 
the dealings of the Western Franks and Alfred
with the Vikings – the former traditionally 
damned as a failure; the latter hailed as a 
spectacular success. In fact, Frankish treaties 
with Vikings not only worked but also 
enhanced the standing of a number of rulers 
– these were not embarrassing episodes of 
compromise but moments to be celebrated. 
And they may have influenced Alfred – who 
had visited the court of Charles the Bald in 
West Francia as a young boy in the 850s – for 
he, too, was aware of the value of bringing 
Vikings into the Christian fold. 

Although not particularly successful in the 
long term, the baptism by Charles the Bald’s 
father, Emperor Louis the Pious, of the 
Danish ruler Harald Klak in 826 had been a 
seminal event in the Carolingian court. Here 
we might trace the transformation from 
‘Northmen’ to ‘Danes’, as Frankish authors 
took the event to their hearts as a means of 
depicting the imperial idea of Frankish 
kingship. 

Around this time, Frankish writers started 
to take a serious interest in who ‘Danes’ were, 
and, given the Anglo-Saxons’ preoccupation 
with Frankish affairs, it is perhaps not 
surprising that this is echoed in England a 
generation or two later. Charles the Bald had 
been a young boy at the ceremony and it 
evidently had a major effect on him, just as 
Alfred’s visit to the Frankish court had an 
impact on the Anglo-Saxon ruler’s life.

Moment of triumph 
An example of how a spirit of compromise 
had permeated Alfred’s Wessex is provided by
the fact that Vikings were serving in the 
community of the Somerset monastery of 
Athelney, a site founded to celebrate Alfred’s 
great moment of triumph in 878. The famous 
biographer of Alfred’s life, Asser of St David’s,
described them as “pagans” (pagani). Yet 
clearly they were not really pagans in the 
religious sense – they were, after all, part of a 
Christian community. 

Around the same time, Alfred received the 
Scandinavian sea captain, Óttarr (Anglicised 
as Ohthere), at court. Óttarr is described in an
Old English text as “most northern of the 
North-men”. Just as the fictional Uhtred 
comes to the West Saxon court in The Last 
Kingdom, this ninth-century view of Alfred 
has the king using Óttarr to discover more 
about the lands and peoples of Scandinavia. 
This provides further evidence that, though

the Viking threat had by no means disap-
peared, these ‘North-men’ were very different 
from those who had perpetrated the apoca-
lyptic attacks of a few decades earlier. 

The lands they lived in were no longer 
mysterious. The understanding of them was 
more subtle, more complex, and far more 
human. Indeed, an object similar to the 
so-called ‘Alfred Jewel’, an artefact described 
by an Old English text as an æstel, has been 
found during excavations of a chieftain’s 
complex at Borg on the Lofoten Islands in 
northern Norway. Did Óttarr carry the ‘Borg 
Æstel’ back home after his stay at the West 
Saxon court? If so, it showed that a symbol of 
Alfred’s lordship – these objects were, after 
all, closely linked with Alfred’s court – had 
huge resonance in Scandinavia.

Óttarr was not an ‘Englishman’ but in some 
respects his relationship with “his lord 
Alfred” demonstrates that relationships 
between peoples were about more than just 
ties of blood and clearly-defined nationhood. 

This remained the case well into the 
10th century. For though the West Saxons’ 
expansion in the early 900s saw English 
Christians forcing Danes and other Vikings 
into submission through strongarm tactics, 
‘Danes’ and ‘English’ continued to make 
agreements and negotiate over territory in a 
way that mirrored their predecessors’ 
diplomacy. 

In fact, the descendants of ninth-century 
Scandinavian lords became the ‘men’ of 
English rulers – particularly Edward the Elder 
(899–924) and Æthelstan (924–39) – who 
allowed their new subjects to keep their lands 
in return for a submission to lordship. 

So this was not purely a story of nationhood 
or of the triumph of one group over another. 
Instead, the Vikings’ role in the making of 
‘England’ demonstrated that different 
peoples’ dealings with one another needed to 
be defined by flexibility as much as by 
factionalism and conflict.

University of Winchester. He has co-edited Danes 

in Wessex (Oxbow), which is out later this year



Wessex
Ruled by the descendants of
Ecgberht, who had seized power
at the start of the ninth century,
the West Saxon kingdom con-
trolled much of the south of
England by the time of Alfred the
Great (reigned 871–99), who
managed to hold onto his throne
in the face of Viking attacks.

Alba
By the late ninth century, the areas controlled by 
kings of the Picts and Scots were beginning to be 
referred to as Alba, the Gaelic word for ‘Britain’, 
suggesting change was in the air. The kingdom of 
Alba was controlled by a line of rulers, of the 
house of Alpín, who emerged during the ninth-
century upheaval of Viking attacks to assert 
domination over large swathes of territory which 
would form the core of a later Scottish kingdom.

East Anglia
The last independent Anglo-Sax-
on king of the East Angles was
killed by Vikings in 869 and is
remembered as St Edmund. East
Anglia became a Viking kingdom
under the control of Guthrum,
christened Æthelstan in 878.
A decade of peace led to control
by other Vikings after Guthrum’s
death, but their coins bearing the
name of St Edmund reveal
how they ‘bought into’
Anglo-Saxon politics.

Mercia
Kings of Mercia had held overlordship over other
Anglo-Saxon kingdoms during the eighth
century, but remained a force to be reckoned
with in the ninth. Years of hard campaigning led
to the replacement of the Mercians’ king in 874 by
a ruler who may have been a Viking ‘puppet’, then
by Æthelred, an ealdorman (governor) likely to
have been subordinate to King Alfred.

Northumbria and  
the Kingdom of York
The kingdom of the Northumbrians had been 
created by the merging of the southern kingdom 
of Deira, focused on York, and the northern 
kingdom of Bernicia. Vikings controlled York from 
the 860s and settled soon after, while Bamburgh 
remained a seat of continuing Anglo-Saxon 
power in the north.

THE ROYAL NAVY’S
AMERICAN DISASTER

Britain was the world’s greatest naval power, so why did its ships fail to 

prevent the American revolutionaries securing independence?

standing army or navy, won its independence from Great Britain, the
most powerful country in the world, a country 3,000 miles away,
which could wield such sea power that it could block out the sun with
its sails and hide the surface of the sea with its ships; a country that
had so dominated its rivals at sea in a previous conflict, the Seven
Years’ War, that it now commanded a maritime empire of unprece-
dented geographical scale and financial resources.

The bare facts are compelling. At the start of the war, the Ameri-
cans had no navy of any sort and no allies at all, and Great Britain
committed nearly half of its navy, the largest in the world, to Ameri-
ca. They also successfully transported nearly 50,000 troops across
the Atlantic and maintained those men with clothes, weapons and
food via a maritime umbilical cord that ran all the way back to Brit-
ain – an unprecedented logistical feat. So how could it be that they
then went on to lose the war?

An aspect of this historical conundrum that particularly charmed
me was that there was a clear bridge between past and present. As I
dug further, it soon became apparent that contemporaries also
boggled at the idea and struggled to come to terms with how, as one
observer put it, “such an army [as the British], so well appointed,
served by so large a train of artillery, and attended by so numerous a
fleet, could fail of success against a divided people, destitute of offi-
cers, soldiers, magazines, fortified town, ships of war, or any appar-
ent resources”.

George Washington himself, commander-in-chief of the Ameri-
can rebels, believed that, in future, the story would be considered as
nothing less than fiction: “For it will not be believed that such a force
as Great Britain has employed for eight years in this counhis coun-
try could be baffled in their plan for subjugating
it by numbers infinitely less, composed of men
oftentimes half starved; always in rags, without
pay, and experiencing, at times, every species of
distress which human nature is capable of
undergoing.”

In our collective national consciousness we
are so often reminded of the strength and resil-
ience of British sea power – a narrative domi-
nated in the age of sail by men such as Drake,
Cook and Nelson, who wielded colossal power
with ingenuity and courage and in doing so were

supported by a host of brave tars, their hearts of oak beating out
of their chests behind the beloved wooden walls of their
indefatigable navy.

The idea that this might not, actually, be the case, and in particular
that the great cleaving of the British empire and the independence of
America, one of the clearest foundation blocks in the formation of
our modern world, might have been the result of naval weakness –
dare I even think it, incompetence – sparked a fascination with thise
period for me that has lasted nearly 20 years. It was also clear that
these bald facts were largely responsible for a subsequent tendency
for many Americans to believe that their independence was some-
how pre-ordained. This is one of the most powerful inspirations for
any historian, for such a tendency towards disbelief draws us to re-
search like moths to a flame.

In my work since then I have set out to explain that conundrum
and I have discovered that the explanation lies not in black and white
– in large or small numbers of ships and men, in experience and
innocence, in skill and incompetence – but in the most complex quilt
of influence and effect that rests likes a blanket over the entire
period. To study it helps us to understand this key moment in the
shaping of the modern world, as well as broader questions of the
influence of sea power upon history – for this, ultimately, is a war at
sea that encourages you to think about what a war at sea actually is.

Histories of the American War of Independence no longer treat
the naval battle as the merest of afterthoughts. One can easily
discover how sea power affected the revolution, though it is usually
restricted to a single example: the battle of the Chesapeake of 1781,

when a French naval fleet defeated a British fleet
leading to the isolation and subsequent surrender
of the British general Charles Cornwallis and his
entire army at Yorktown. Cornwallis’s surrender
directly led to the fall of the British government
and its replacement with one committed to
ending the war. Thus the link between sea power
and American independence is traditionally
made manifest.

But to understand how sea power actually
affected the war in its myriad ways, one must
consider together a vast number of themes
which include – but are by no means restricted to

H

the day, as a student, I opened a slim book in my university

– the role of the French navy, the Spanish navy, the ‘Continental 
Navy’ (the American navy representing the rebellious colonies  
acting together), 12 of the 13 rebellious colonies who formed their 
own navies, the Royal Navy, the Dutch navy, the Russian navy, the 
Indian navy, the role of native Americans in fleets of canoes, the 
maritime economy, shipping, logistics, hurricanes and tidal waves, 
shipbuilding, invasion, slavery, fashion, evacuation, law, politics  
and economics. 

And all of these themes must be applied to a conflict that was,  
unquestionably, the greatest naval war of the age of sail. From first 
gasp to last whimper it lasted a decade; it was the longest war in 
American history until Vietnam two centuries later; it involved 22 
(yes, 22!) different navies and thousands of privateers from tens of 
different nations; it was fought in five different oceans as well as on 
land-locked lakes and majestic rivers; it included the most strategi-
cally significant naval battle in all of British, American or French  
history and one of the most one-sided and tactically decisive naval  
battles in history; it involved more fleet battles than any other naval 
war in history; it included some of the largest fleets of sailing  
warships ever gathered together and some of the strangest and most 
eclectic fleets ever to sail to war, including a fleet that was taken to 
pieces, dragged through a forest and then re-built on an inland lake. 
The amphibious operations – and particularly the role of sailors 
fighting on land – are especially important and interesting: on more 
than one occasion ‘land’ battles were contested entirely by sailors  
firing naval guns. 

This was also a war in which sea power affected the lives of non-
combatants in profound ways. The American Revolution meant that 
the lives of many more people were touched by the sea than before it. 
Many Europeans – soldiers, sailors and civilians – took to the sea in 
the military operations or the many forced evacuations that so char-
acterised the war. Thousands crossed the Atlantic and visited  
America, the Caribbean, Central America, Canada and Newfound-
land for the first time. Others voyaged into the North 
Sea and Baltic, to the Mediterranean, and around Good 
Hope to India. 

The result is a gold mine of historical sources unique 
to the period: diaries filled with awe at the majesty of 
nature – narwhals and flying fish, icebergs and islands 
covered in thousands of sea birds – and fascination 
and astonishment when the populations of dif-
ferent nations collided. Before he saw his first 
real Frenchman, one American believed 
them to be “pale, ugly specimens who 
lived exclusively on frogs and snails”. 
There is also tangible shock at the 
unique life of the sailor – the smell, 
the cramped conditions, the heat, 
the cold, the damp, the noise, the 
seasickness – and horror at the 

experience of naval battle.
All of these people were, essentially, baptised in the maritime 

world, and in the peculiarities of sea power, during this war. For 
them, the scale and potential of the world had expanded, their hori-
zons had broadened. This war was nothing less than a key moment in 
the western human race reconnecting with each other and painting 
the Atlantic world and beyond in a new colour.

W
hen we come to analyse the reasons for 
Britain’s failure, one can explore innu-
merable themes and campaigns which all 
influenced the war’s outcome. 

But what we can say is that the initial re-
bellion was in part provoked and then 
inflamed by both perceptions of British 

sea power and the methods of its implementation. The subsequent 
war, of necessity played out in part at sea, led to the Americans form-
ing their own navies and allying themselves with Britain’s two tradi-
tional naval enemies, France and Spain. The war thus spilled out 
from the American seaboard and became a global struggle with far 
more than just the future of the American colonies at stake. 

Both before and after this key moment, the British failed to use 
their naval advantages at the appropriate times and in the appropri-
ate ways. In particular, with insufficient ships at the start of the war, 
they were unable to adequately police the growth of American sea 
power or blockade the coast effectively. 

Furthermore, when the war spread, they chose not to contain 
French and Spanish fleets in European waters and struggled with the 
challenge of wielding sea power in numerous theatres, all distant 
from the logistical infrastructure of the home dockyards. On  
numerous occasions the very survival of the British empire hung on 
a spider’s silk. Smelling British blood, Britain’s traditional allies, the 
Dutch, then also turned against them. Weighed down on all sides, 

the British war effort creaked and groaned until, en-
tirely unexpectedly, by applying exactly the right 
amount of pressure in exactly the right place at exactly 
the right time, the Americans and their allies made it 
break at the battle of Yorktown, where British hopes of 
victory were dashed for good.

One abiding theme in this narrative concerns just 
how extraordinarily difficult it was for any na-

tion to wage naval war of any type in this pe-
riod and the different ways in which it was 

possible to experience that difficulty. 
Naval warfare, for example, raised 

unique problems at the level of 
strategy and inter-theatre opera-
tions simply because of the slow-
ness of communication. It would 
usually take at least a month for

a message to travel across the Atlantic, and obviously at least twice as 
long to receive a reply – and this was not just about communication 
but propaganda. Often, after crucial engagements, the British and 
Americans found themselves in a race to get news across the Atlantic 
and any advantage that could be manufactured in this race was crucial. 

The idea of a naval ‘strategy’ as we know it was also non-existent. 
The phrase did not even exist. This was not an era of men leaning 
over huge chart tables, moving little model ships around: so many 
here to meet this threat; so many there to put pressure on that gov-
ernment; so many here to defend trade. Quite to the contrary: war 
planners had only a loose understanding of exactly how each theatre 
of war would affect the other, and capability was so limited and un-

predictable that, when combined with the slowness of communica-
tion, any real planning was far more likely to fail than succeed. In-
deed, if there is one prominent theme from the numerous operations 
I’ve studied it is that, with only a handful of exceptions, none of them 
work out as planned. 

The weather played an immense part. Naval warfare in the age of 
sail was always influenced by the weather, but it seems to have been 
particularly so, and particularly severe, for this war. All of this meant 
that sea power was hardly a surgical instrument of war – more of a 
heavy blunt club wielded by a blind and drunk weakling.

At the level of tactics, naval operations were confounded by limita-
tions in signalling and by the fact that there was no shared inter-ser-

British shores sick as dogs”

vice doctrine. In essence, this meant that a fleet under one com-
mander in one part of the world would operate with different
signals, tactics and a different understanding of expected behav-
iour to another fleet elsewhere in the world. It is in fact more help-
ful to think of it like this: a ‘navy’ was not a ‘navy’ but consisted of
numerous different ‘navies’ that worked in different ways. This
did not make for reliable performance. Fleets working in interna-
tional alliances suffered particularly severely from this type of
problem. It was almost impossible to get different fleets within a
single navy to co-operate with each other, let alone
different fleets from different navies.

Economically and administratively, navies presented enor-
mous difficulties too. They were both immensely expensive to
run and also very difficult to maintain at any level of strength.
Men had to be found to man the ships, and those men had to be
fed, clothed and kept healthy. In some theatres, such as the Carib-
bean, this was an insurmountable problem at which every
administration failed, even in the comfort of home waters. In the
early years of the war, the British repeatedly sent ‘fresh’ fleets to
America, where their weight was expected to shift the balance of
the war – but, with inadequate infrastructure in home waters, 

they often sailed from British shores sick as dogs. The French and
Spanish were simply unable to keep their men healthy for any
significant period of time.

Old established navies like the British and French faced the
same problems as one another, but at a different scale from new
ones such as the Continental Navy or the various state navies.
However every navy also faced its own unique challenges. While
the British, for example, were struggling with the problem of pro-
tecting their supply lines to America, and the French with how to
source sufficient nails to secure sheets of copper to their ships’
hulls, the Americans struggled with problems specific to fledg-
ling navies: what rules and regulations should the men abide by at
sea? How were prizes to be distributed and administered without
prize courts? Even the most basic questions took up time: who 
was going to design the uniform?

T
his is one of the most important themes of this
war. More than anything else, the story of the
conflict is a story of the struggle for sea power
and of how the difficulty of wielding it shaped
the modern world. It remained the case in every
country that, in spite of staggering naval expen-
diture, politicians who made policy had no de-

tailed knowledge of naval affairs and few expert advisers. Chance
and the weather could ruin everything as easily as bad planning.
For the historian, the idea of a ‘chain’ of events is therefore almost
completely unhelpful. Events in this war were not strong
and joined to each other by iron links but were flimsy, like a
house of cards.

The result was an almost constant sense of apprehension and
drama from 1774 right up until the Peace of Paris, which ended
the war in 1783. All of which makes this one of the most fascinat-
ing conflicts in history to study, and also one of the most exciting
to discover.

And there’s a twist in the tale… for the Americans won their
independence after eight long years of war at exactly the moment
that Britain’s superior naval, logistical and financial infrastruc-
ture achieved an unassailable position of strength at sea. This was
a position that, after the war was over, would herald the Royal 
Navy’s greatest period of imperial reach and power.

WWI eyewitness accounts 

A ravenous war
In part 18 of his personal testimony series, Peter Hart takes us to November 1915, when 

the carnage at Gallipoli and the western front made the need to blood new recruits ever 

more pressing. Peter will be tracing the experiences of 20 people who lived through the 

First World War – via interviews, letters and diary entries – as its centenary progresses

OUR FIRST WORLD WAR

John Palmer

John Palmer joined the army as a regular in 
1910. He served as a signaller with the 
Royal Field Artillery on the western front.

At the start of November 1915,
Bombardier John Palmer was
still suffering the aftereffects
of wounds sustained during
the battle of Loos. Despite
this, he was posted back to
the front to join the 105
Battery, 22nd Brigade, Royal
Field Artillery. He would not
last long. On 5 November he
was on duty at a forward
observation post.

We got mixed up with
a German attack and

I came out of it with a broken rib
caused by a bayonet thrust. As
the Jerry lunged at me, I turned
slightly and the point of the
bayonet caught my rib, broke it
and skidded off. I do not know
actually just what happened after
that, but we struggled for the rifle
and that was the last I knew –
until I was dug out of the trench
some time later. I was told that a
shell had burst on the parapet
and we were both buried. I was
underneath, drenched in blood,

Joe Murray

Joe grew up in a County Durham mining 
community. He arrived in Gallipoli with the 
Hood Battalion of the Royal Naval Division 
in April 1915 and was soon moved to 
engineering duties as a sapper.

“I looked at this shirt and, believe it or

not, the blinking lice were still alive and

crawling all over it! They’d been three

days in a block of ice”

Out in Gallipoli, Ordinary
Seaman Joe Murray was still
attached to the VIII Corps
Mining Company. The
weather had been getting
cooler but on 26 November
a terrible rainstorm lashed
down on them. Flash floods
engulfed the gullies, building
up behind the trench lines and
then breaking through by
sheer weight of water.

All of a sudden the dam 
would break and the 

whole volume came down 
carrying everything before it. 
Corpses, all sorts of gear, some 
people drowning. 

The Turks were standing 
about and so were we. There was
no trench to go in – they were all
full up with water. It was raining
like hell. They were standing 
there, and we made no attempt 
to do anything. We couldn’t. 
Half of us didn’t have any rifles 
– they’d been flooded in the 
trench somewhere. 

The Turks could have walked 
through as far as they liked. 
There was no defence at all. Not 
where we were. Everywhere was 
washed up. Fellows ill with 
dysentery had fallen down and 
drowned in their own commu-
nication trenches and of course 

none of which was mine. The hilt 
of the bayonet was against my 
breast and the blade had 
completely transfixed the Jerry 
– it was his blood which was 
soaking me. It was a miracle 
which must have caused it. How 
the bayonet became detached 
from the rifle I shall never know.

Carted away to the dressing 
station where the doctor was 
quite sarcastic. He just said: “An 
eighth of an inch higher, an 
eighth of an inch lower, and I 
should not have to worry about 
you, as it is all you have got is a 
cracked rib!” 

That was not all I had though. 
I knew it now. I was cracking up. 
Frightened by the shells however 
far away. I feel I have changed a 
lot since we first landed in this 
country some 15 months ago. 
Then we were all thrilled and 
anxious and eager to meet the 
Germans and show them just 
what we were made of. Now we 
really know what war means. 
The loss of so many of our pals, 
the death, destruction, blood and 
mud. All I long for now is home 
and to get out of this living hell. 

On 13 November, John Palmer 
was finally sent home. He 
would be back to face a new 
hell on the Somme in 1916. 

other people were going down 
walking on them. It wasn’t till 
after the storm that we realised 
what a lot of people were 
drowned. 

The rain was followed by a 
terrible freeze, bringing Arctic 
conditions to Gallipoli. 
Hundreds of men died and 
thousands had to be evacu-
ated suffering from severe 
hypothermia. Yet Joe discov-
ered that not even entomb-
ment in a block of ice could 
rid his shirt of lice.

I spread my shirt on  
a stone in the trench 

behind me – it had been three 
days in a solid block of ice. And 
do you know, I looked at this 
shirt and, believe it or not, the 
blinking lice were still alive and 
crawling all over it! They’d been 
three days in a block of ice. 
You’d have thought that would 
have killed the damn things – 
but it didn’t!

PART 18 NOVEMBER 1915

NEXT ISSUE: “I went up to my neck into a French latrine”

Hawtin Mundy had been
wounded on the western front
in May 1915. After recovering,
he was sent to recruit in
Newport Pagnell under the
new Derby Scheme which had
been introduced in October
1915. War was ravenous for
men and the stream of willing
recruits had dried up. Under
this new scheme, men aged
18–40 years old could enlist
voluntarily or attest (enrol)
with the obligation to report
for duty if called up later in the
war. This was a clear pointer
that compulsory conscription
was being considered.

Those that wouldn’t join 
the Derby Scheme, we 

had to hunt for them. We were 
allowed a penny a mile on our 
bicycles to go round to the 
villages and farms in the district.

Those that did come and sign 
up often told us: “Farmer so and 
so, he’s got two sons, they won’t 
join up, they don’t intend 
joining up until they’re forced 
to!” As soon as we got a tip like 
that, away we went. We got to 
the farm, see the farmer, his sons 
would be in the fields, we’d find 

them and what they had to do
was sign a form so that they 
could be called up eventually 
– not to join straight away – but 
to be called up when the time 
came. Well they used to try and 
dodge that! 

We were tipped off about this 
farmer. He’d got a big, strapping
son who was having nothing to 
do with the war. The farmer 
took me into his sitting room 
and we had a chat. I’d got my 
forms in my pocket for him to 
sign. He said: “Would you like a 
drink?” I said: “Yes!” We sat at 
the table near the window and 
he brought an old-fashioned 
stone jar full of whisky. He 
totted it out and he asked if it 
could be possible if I could 
“leave it” for a time. I said: “Oh 
no! No! They’re all joining, all 
signing these forms now – he 
can’t get out of it.” 

He kept topping the whisky 
up, topping it up! When I came 
out I’d got the forms in my 
pocket but I hadn’t got his 
signature, and how the hell  
I got back to Newport on my 
bike, I don’t know!

Jack Dorgan

Northumberland-born Jack Dorgan took part 
in the attack on St Julien during the second 
battle of Ypres. After the battle he was 
promoted to sergeant and continued to serve 
on the western front throughout 1915.

Edmund Williams

Edmund was born on 10 January 1894 in
Formby, to a fairly well-off family. After
studying chemistry at technical college,
in September 1914 he had volunteered to
join the 19th King’s Liverpool Regiment
with his brother.

Hawtin Mundy

Hawtin was brought up in Buckinghamshire 
and served as an apprentice coach-builder. 
At the outbreak of war, he and his pal Sid 
Carroll joined the 1/1st Battalion of the 
Oxfordshire and Buckinghamshire Light 
Infantry at Aylesbury. 

On 5 November 1915, the 19th
King’s Liverpool Regiment,
their home training complete,
crossed over to France. With
them was Private Edmund
Williams, and as they moved
up towards the front line they
stopped for a while at the
village of Vignacourt.

Vignacourt was quite a
nice little village, but it

was an unfriendly village…
because some of the troops had
misbehaved themselves there
and left the results of their 
misbehaviour behind. 

In the billets there was this 
young girl, she might be 16 or 
17 years old. She had what the 
French called le petit mal – in 
other words, slight epilepsy. She 
was far gone in pregnancy and

cursed us – because we took the 
blame for what the predecessors 
had done.

Sergeant Jack Dorgan of the

rum ration to his platoon.

The ration would come 
up in a rum jar: about 

14 inches high, a stone jar with  
a handle and a stopper. It had to 
be issued by an officer and an 
NCO. Being one of the only 
teetotal sergeants in the 
battalion, I was invariably  

the rum sergeant! 

Everybody would be up and 
waiting for it. Word soon spread: 
“The rum ration’s on the job!” 
The officer would carry the rum 
jar and I would have a large 
spoon and the ration consisted 
of one spoonful. The rum we 
had was much stronger than the 
rum we have today! 

The spoon was always licked 
by the fellow when he received 
his ration. That cleaned it ready

WHO WERE 
THE 

CELTS?

“T
he whole race… is 
war-mad, high-spirited 
and quick to battle… And 
so when they are stirred 
up they assemble in their 
bands for battle quite 

openly and without forethought.” So wrote 
the Greek historian Strabo about the Celts at 
the beginning of the first century AD. It is a 
generalisation that has coloured our view of 
the northern neighbours of the Romans and 
Greeks ever since. 

Celts first came into the consciousness of 
early modern historians in the 16th and 17th 
centuries when the works of classical writers 
like Strabo, Caesar and Livy were becoming 
widely available. These texts describe how 
the many barbarian tribes of western and 
central Europe came into conflict with the 
Roman and Greek worlds. The writers called 
these disparate peoples  ‘Celts’ or ‘Gauls’ – a 
tradition that is at least as early as the sixth 
century BC, when the ethnographer 
Hecataeus of Miletus wrote of Celts living in 
the hinterland of the Greek colony of 

Massalia (Marseilles). Later, in the fourth 
century BC, the Greek historian Ephorus of 
Cymae believed that barbarian Europe was 
occupied by only two peoples, the Scythians 
in the east and the Celts in the west, and 
Strabo adds the gloss that Ephorus consid-
ered Celtica to be so large that it included 
most of Iberia as far as Gades (Cadiz). These 
early generalisations were accepted by the 
later Roman authors when they came to write 
about their growing contacts with the 
peoples of central and western Europe. 

In the fifth century BC, quite possibly as a 
result of an exponential increase in popula-
tion, the tribes occupying a broad arc 
including the Loire valley, the Marne region, 
the Rhineland and Bohemia began to take on 
a new mobility, thousands of people moving 
en masse out of their homelands. These were 
the Celts. One of the migrating hordes thrust 
southwards through the Alpine passes to the 
Po Valley, where the disparate tribes settled 
down in reasonable harmony. Another  
moved eastwards to the fertile country of 
Transdanubia (Hungary) and beyond that

was acquainted with the system of nature that
the Greeks call natural philosophy and he
used to predict the future both by augury and
inference”. The orator was impressed. The
picture we can glean from these engagements
is of a sophisticated people, quite different
from the image of hairy, naked savages
rushing blindly into battle.

The archaeological evidence too offers a far
more reliable and unbiased picture of tribal
societies at the time and also enables us to
understand the earlier formative centuries. By
about 1000 BC, much of western and central
Europe shared a broadly similar culture and
set of belief systems, reflecting a society in
which warrior prowess was important. The
foundation of Massalia around 600 BC saw
Mediterranean luxury goods, such as wine
vessels and wine itself, being traded north-
wards to the chiefdoms (called Hallstatt)
occupying a wide zone north of the Alps.
Much of this exotic material was eventually
buried in the graves of the elite, so is well
known to us from the famous burials of Vix

to the middle and lower Danube region
(Serbia, Bulgaria and Romania). Once settled
in their new homelands, the various Celtic
tribes could indulge in raiding – a socially 
embedded system that enabled individuals to
display and enhance their status. From the
Po Valley, raiding parties swept across the
Apennines deep into the Italian peninsula,
confronting Roman armies and, in 390 BC,
besieging Rome itself.

Later, from the middle Danube, other tribes 
penetrated Greece, ravaging the temple of
Apollo at Delphi in 279 BC. Deflected from
Greece, these migrating bands later crossed
the Dardanelles and the Hellespont into Asia
Minor and eventually settled in the vicinity of
modern Ankara, from where they began to
raid the Hellenistic cities of the Aegean coast.
The raids lasted until the powerful state of
Pergamon successfully defeated the maraud-
ers in a series of engagements. To commemo-
rate these campaigns, a victory monument
was erected at Pergamon depicting the
defeated enemy. The famous statue of the
Dying Gaul, now in Rome, is a copy of one of 
the figures.

Image problem
The classical world, then, came into conflict
with Celts in Italy, Greece and Asia Minor.
As victors, they wrote of these strange 
barbarians, carefully depicting them as ‘other’ 
by emphasising the characteristics that
distinguished them from the civilised
Mediterraneans: the Celts were brave fighters, 
but lost heart and ran away – unlike the
steadfast Romans; the Celts drank wine
undiluted and got drunk – unlike the
Romans, who diluted theirs and remained
sober; the Celts fought naked in battle – un-
like the well-armed Romans, and so on. It was
a biased picture – a caricature almost – but,
like any good caricature, it had within it some
elements of the truth.

Much of our popular picture of the Celts
comes from these very biased sources. Later,
in the middle of the first century BC, when
Julius Caesar campaigned in Gaul, we get
from his Commentaries a rather more
balanced picture of many different tribal
groups, often centred on well-established
towns, in various forms of alliance, with
stable systems of government, able to come
together to act in unison against the external
threat posed by Rome. Caesar was reluctantly
impressed by the belief systems of the Gauls
and the centralising power of the druids. One
tribe, the Aedui, sent their chief magistrate,
Divitiacus, who was also a druid, to seek
Roman aid against their enemies. Divitiacus
addressed the Roman Senate and met Cicero,
who wrote that Divitiacus “declared that he

in Burgundy and Hochdorf near Stuttgart.
In return for the luxury goods, the Hallstatt
chiefs in all probability offered raw materials
such as gold, tin and amber, as well as slaves,
which were becoming increasingly important 
to the Mediterranean economy.

Such a system depended on the co-opera-
tion of tribes living around the Hallstatt
chiefdom zone, who acquired and supplied
the raw materials and the slaves. The market 
for slaves encouraged raiding in these
peripheral zones, creating instability that led
to the breakdown of the system in the early
fifth century BC. As a result, the old Hallstatt
chiefdoms collapsed, while the peripheral
groups occupying that arc from the Loire to
Bohemia became increasingly dominant.

These societies shared cultural aspects –
both in burial rites, now focusing on the
warrior, and in a highly original elite art style
expressed mainly in metalwork. In the
archaeological terminology, this cultural
manifestation is called La Tène (after a site ine
Switzerland) and the decorative style is often

referred to as Celtic art. It was from these
La Tène tribes that the migratory movementse
which impacted on the classical world came.

Given this archaeological background, it is
reasonable to argue that the Celts, as defined
by the Hellenistic and Roman writers,
developed from a cultural tradition that can
be traced back in west central Europe well
into the second millennium BC.

When, in the late 17th and early 18th
centuries, antiquarians began to take an
interest in the Celts and Celtic origins, they
had no archaeological evidence to inform
them, but instead had to create hypotheses
based partly on interpretations of the Bible
and partly on the classical sources then
available. The general view to emerge was that
the Celts must have originated somewhere in
the east and moved westwards across Europe,
eventually crossing into Britain and Ireland.
The idea was taken up by a brilliant antiquar-
ian and linguist, Edward Lhuyd, keeper of the
Ashmolean Museum in Oxford, who in 1707
published his great work Archaeologia 

Britannica, in which he set out details of his
study of the native languages of Ireland,
Scotland, Wales, Cornwall and Brittany,
recognising them as belonging to the same
family, which he called Celtic. Later, in letters
to friends, he speculated that the languages
had been introduced into Britain, Ireland and
Brittany by waves of Celtic migrants coming
from western central Europe. In this he was
simply following the theories then current.
Lhuyd’s work was to form the cornerstone of
Celtic studies for the next 250 years and
provide the predominant model, which later
scholars were content to follow.

Challenging the consensus
From the mid-19th century, archaeological
evidence began to appear in increasing
quantity and was at first interpreted in terms
of the accepted hypothesis, but by the 1960s
archaeologists were finding it difficult to force
the increasingly sophisticated data set into
Lhuyd’s old linguistic model: there were
things that simply did not fit. Most notably,

there was no convincing archaeological
evidence of migrations from central Europe
into Britain and Ireland, or into Iberia –
regions where the Celtic languages were
known to have been spoken. It was time to
take a new objective look at the evidence.

Out of this has grown a new theory: that the
languages we call Celtic originated in the
Atlantic zone of Europe (Iberia, western
France, Britain and Ireland) as a lingua franca
among the maritime communities who can
be shown to have been in active contact with
each other along the Atlantic seaways from
the fifth millennium BC. Belief systems,
artistic styles and a sophisticated knowledge 
of cosmology were shared along this Atlantic
facade, implying that people could communi-
cate with one another in a common language.

But if the Celtic language developed in this
zone (where, in some areas, it is still spoken),
then how and when did it spread eastwards
into central Europe? The simplest hypothesis
consistent with the archaeological evidence is 
that the advance took place in the second

millennium with the spread of the Maritime
Bell Beaker phenomenon – a time of complex
movements of people, beliefs and knowledge
associated with the rapid development of
copper and bronze metallurgy and the
exploitation of a wide range of raw materials.

By the end of the second millennium, the
Beaker phenomenon embraced the whole of
western and central Europe and provided the
basis from which subsequent Bronze Age
cultures, including those of the early Hallstatt
culture, emerged. The new hypothesis neatly
explains how the Celtic language may have
spread and why the earliest identified Celtic
inscriptions, dating to the seventh century
BC, are to be found in south-western Iberia. If
we accept that speakers of the Celtic language
can be called Celts then, by this hypothesis,
the Celts originated in Atlantic Europe long
before the Greeks and Romans first encoun-
tered them in the mid-first millennium BC.

Whether the new hypothesis will stand the
tests of time remains to be seen, but powerful
new techniques of scientific analysis are being
developed to create entirely new data sets to
put alongside the archaeological and linguis-
tic evidence. The most promising of these, the
study of ancient DNA derived from human
bone, will enable us to chart the movements
of populations and to see if the ancestors of
the Celts really did come from the west.

In 1963, despairing at the fragmented
nature of Celtic studies, JRR Tolkein wrote:
“Celtic of any sort is… a magic bag into
which anything may be put, and out of which
anything may come… Anything is possible
in the fabulous Celtic twilight, which is not
so much a twilight of the gods as of the
reason.” He would, I think, be reassured that
Celtic studies are now in vigorous good
health and are at last emerging from the
dimly lit realms.

Archaeology at the University of Oxford. He is the 

author of Britain Begins (OUP, 2013)

The word Celtic was loosely used by the
classical writers and has continued to be 
loosely used in more recent times to such a 
degree that some commentators question 
whether it has any value at all. Julius 
Caesar, however, very specifically said that 

the region between the rivers 
Garonne and Seine was known 

to its inhabitants as Celtica 
and this is supported by a 

late fourth-century BC 
writer, Pytheas, who 
refers to the projecting 
mass of the Armorican 
peninsula as Keltike. 
But no ancient writer 
refers to the Britons  

as Celts.
The poem Ora Mari-

tima, which makes use of 
sources going back to the 

sixth century, calls Britain “the 
island of the Albiones”, adding that 

Ireland was inhabited by the Hierni, but the 
more widely used name was Prettanike or 
Pretannia whence came the name Britan-
nia, familiar to the Romans. Prettanike may 
come from the word ‘painted ones’, 
referring to body decorations of the 
natives. If so, it may not be an ethnonym
(the name people called themselves), but
a description of the islanders reported to
Pytheas by the neighb
ants of Gaul.

So can we call 
the Britons and 
Irish Celtic? That 
they were indig-
enous people and 
not immigrants is 
now broadly agreed, 
but they were bound 
to continental Europe 
by networks of 

connectivity across the English Channel
and southern North Sea and along the 
Atlantic seaways, and through these 
connections they shared aspects of their 
culture with their continental neighbours. 
The most dramatic is ‘Celtic art’, which 
developed in western central Europe and 
was being introduced into Britain and 
Ireland by the fourth century BC to be 
copied and developed by local craftsmen. 
The motifs of Celtic art were redolent with 
meaning and reflected belief systems that 
the Britons must now have held in common 
with their continental neighbours.

More telling is the fact that the Celtic 
language was used in Britain and Ireland as 
well as across much of the continent – and 
there is good reason to suggest that the 
language first developed in the Atlantic 
zone. If so, then the Irish and the Britons, 
as early Celtic speakers, have a strong 
claim to be classified as Celts. 

That said, while the tribes in regular 
contact with the continent will have 
recognised their similarities with their 
continental neighbours, they will also have 
been conscious of their differences. They 
will have seen themselves as first and 
foremost a member of their tribe, but they 
will also have recognised an affinity with
those across the Channel. Whether they
regarded their common language and

enjamin West’s painting
The Death of General Wolfe
(shown right) was the popular
hit of the Royal Academy’s
summer exhibition of 1771.
The actor David Garrick
delighted exhibition-goers one

morning by posing in front of West’s picture
and enacting his view of how the general
died. Newspapers reported how the ageing
and infirm former prime minister William
Pitt contemplated the picture for a long time
before declaring that “there was too much
dejection not only in the dying hero’s face, but
in the faces of the surrounding officers, who…
as Englishmen should forget all traces of
private misfortunes, when they had so grandly
conquered for their country”.

On busy days, more than a thousand people
would visit the exhibition. By the time it
closed, 22,485 catalogues had been sold. Wolfe
was the most talked-about picture of the most
successful art exhibition yet held in London.

General James Wolfe was Britain’s greatest
imperial martyr – the 32-year-old having been
killed achieving victory at the battle of Quebec
in 1759, which effectively delivered control
of French Canada to Britain. West’s bold
depiction of his death electrified the public. A
subsequent engraving of the painting became

just news, but history.
The war between Britain and France,

industrialisation, the rapid growth of cities and
the ‘rise’ of the middle class had all stimulated
a public hunger for history that could make
sense of the rapid and often bewildering
changes that were affecting the lives of
18th-century Britons. That demand was to be
satisfied by the development of a new type of
history writing, ‘philosophical history’.

The first mass-market historian in Britain
was the Huguenot soldier of fortune Paul de
Rapin de Thoyras, whose History of England,
published from 1725 as a shilling-an-
instalment part-work, was such a success that a
newspaper reported “no book in our language
had ever more buyers or readers”. But sadly
Rapin’s work was as dull as it was accessible.

It was the sparkling prose of David Hume
that really ignited the 18th-century history
boom. Compare these two accounts of the
execution of Charles I. Rapin wrote how, “the
king suffered death with great constancy, and
without showing the least signs of weakness or
amazement”. Where Rapin plodded, Hume
soared, writing that the executioner “held up

one of the most widely distributed images of 
the entire 18th century.

The significance of Wolfe’s success was dues
both to the appeal of its subject and to West’s 
innovative treatment of it. In the hierarchical
world of 18th-century culture, artists’ choice
of subject matter, and how they went about
depicting it, was rigidly circumscribed.

Academic theory declared that the highest
form of art was history painting, with its 
repertoire of subjects chosen from the Bible, 
mythology or ancient history. Even
contemporary subjects were to be treated
as if they emerged from the classical past.

Unsurprisingly, when George III was told
that West proposed to paint Wolfe and his
comrades in contemporary dress, he remarked
that it was “thought very ridiculous to exhibit
heroes in coats, breeches, and cock’d hats”.
Undaunted, West did just that and also painted
the fallen hero in the pose of the dead Christ, 
familiar from centuries of pictures of the
Lamentation in churches across Europe.

West used the language of the highest and
most sacred form of art to elevate a great
contemporary event to the status of epic
drama. The result has been characterised as
“the revolution in history painting”, but it was
much more than that: Wolfe was the first greate
visual expression of a revolution in historical
consciousness, which transformed the way that
men and women of the 18th century thought
about the past and the present.

The historical nation
The flurry of programmes on television, the
rise of the celebrity-historian, the books at the
top of the bestseller lists… all demonstrate that
history has never been so popular. But our
present-day history boom has its roots in the
18th century. As one of the star historians of
the period, David Hume, joyfully proclaimed
in 1770: “This is the historical age and this the
historical nation.”

So why did history become so popular in the
18th century? There is no single answer, but it
helps to first look at what became known as the
‘Quarrel of the Ancients and the Moderns’.
This was a bitter ideological war waged
in France and England, which asked whether
the intellectual achievements of modern
men and women could ever equal those of
the ancient poets, playwrights, statesmen
and philosophers.

It was a great leap forward when someone
like the author James Boswell could declare:
“I do sincerely think that this age is better
than ancient times.” Such assertions are at the
very basis of what we can call a modern
attitude or, as the 20th-century French
philosopher Michel Foucault put it, “the will to
heroise the present”. Implicit in this, is a belief
that the great events of the modern day are not

to the spectators the head streaming with
blood, and cried aloud, This is the head of a
traitor!… Never monarch, in the full triumph
of success and victory, was more dear to his
people, than his misfortunes and
magnanimity, his patience and piety, had
rendered this unhappy prince.”

Hume played his audience like a violin. “The
first quality of an historian is to be true and
impartial,” he wrote to his friend William
Mure. “The next to be interesting. If you do not
say that I have done both parties justice; and if
Mrs Mure be not sorry for poor King Charles,
I shall burn all my papers and return to
philosophy.” Hume never returned to
philosophy: history’s rewards were too great.

The mastery of prose and a gift for
emotional engagement were not the only
winning talents of the philosophical historians.
Whereas most history writing from
Thucydides onwards was more or less intended
to be a how-to guide for the ruling classes –
providing lessons in statesmanship, diplomacy 
and moral leadership – the philosophical
historians painted with a broad brush. They 
expanded the scope of history away from a

WHO WERE 
THE 

The Celts

“T
he whole race… is 
war-mad, high-spirited 
and quick to battle… And 
so when they are stirred 
up they assemble in their 
bands for battle quite 

openly and without forethought.” So wrote 
the Greek historian Strabo about the Celts at 
the beginning of the first century AD. It is a 
generalisation that has coloured our view of 
the northern neighbours of the Romans and 
Greeks ever since. 

Celts first came into the consciousness of 
early modern historians in the 16th and 17th 
centuries when the works of classical writers 
like Strabo, Caesar and Livy were becoming 
widely available. These texts describe how 
the many barbarian tribes of western and 
central Europe came into conflict with the 
Roman and Greek worlds. The writers called 
these disparate peoples  ‘Celts’ or ‘Gauls’ – a 
tradition that is at least as early as the sixth 
century BC, when the ethnographer 
Hecataeus of Miletus wrote of Celts living in 
the hinterland of the Greek colony of 

Massalia (Marseilles). Later, in the fourth 
century BC, the Greek historian Ephorus of 
Cymae believed that barbarian Europe was 
occupied by only two peoples, the Scythians 
in the east and the Celts in the west, and 
Strabo adds the gloss that Ephorus consid-
ered Celtica to be so large that it included 
most of Iberia as far as Gades (Cadiz). These 
early generalisations were accepted by the 
later Roman authors when they came to write 
about their growing contacts with the 
peoples of central and western Europe. 

In the fifth century BC, quite possibly as a 
result of an exponential increase in popula-
tion, the tribes occupying a broad arc 
including the Loire valley, the Marne region, 
the Rhineland and Bohemia began to take on 
a new mobility, thousands of people moving 
en masse out of their homelands. These were 
the Celts. One of the migrating hordes thrust 
southwards through the Alpine passes to the 
Po Valley, where the disparate tribes settled 
down in reasonable harmony. Another  
moved eastwards to the fertile country of 
Transdanubia (Hungary) and beyond that  

A man wears a decorated headband on this 
silver coin, produced by Danube Celts. By 
the time the coin was minted in the first 
century BC, Celtic tribes had made their 
presence felt everywhere from the  
British Isles to Asia Minor

eople who killed each other
– soldiers, sailors, airmen –
were the most conspicuous,
yet in some ways least
interesting, participants in
the Second World War.
Outcomes were also
profoundly influenced by

a host of men and women who never fired
a shot. All of the belligerents waged an
unceasing secret war – a struggle for knowl-
edge of the enemy – to empower their armies,
navies and air forces through espionage and
codebreaking. General Albert Praun, the
Wehrmacht’s last signals chief, wrote
afterwards: “All aspects of this modern ‘cold
war of the air waves’ were carried on con-
stantly even when the guns were silent.”

I thought I knew quite a bit about the war,
but was amazed by some of the tales I
encountered while researching my latest book.
There was the Japanese spy chief whose
exploits caused him to be dubbed by his own
men ‘Lawrence of Manchuria’. And there was
Karl-Heinz Kramer, a German spy in
Stockholm who warned Berlin in September
1944 that the Allies were about to stage a mass
parachute drop to seize a bridge over the
Rhine. His forecast was ignored, and after the
war it was discovered that Kramer’s supposed
British informants were figments of his
imagination: the Arnhem message was an
inspired but wild guess.

Meanwhile, one of the Soviets’ wartime spy
chiefs, Pavel Sudoplatov, earned his spurs by
presenting a Ukrainian nationalist in
Rotterdam with a handsome box of choco-
lates… which blew the man to pieces minutes
later. In the far east, bitter hostility between
British and American secret services reached
a nadir in January 1945, when USAAF aircraft
shot down two RAF Liberators, apparently
deliberately, because they were carrying
French agents into Indochina against
Washington’s wishes.

The Soviet superspy Richard Sorge
(pictured left) once said that spying should be
done bravely – and that was certainly how he
did it. He began his brilliant campaign to
penetrate the German embassy in Tokyo in
1933 by befriending the Wehrmacht colonel 
who soon afterwards became Hitler’s
ambassador – and by sleeping with the
colonel’s wife. Before Sorge was finally
arrested eight years later, and dispatched to
the gallows, there was scarcely a handsome
woman within his reach whom he had not
seduced, nor an embassy secret that had gone
unreported to Moscow.

Not the least remarkable agent of the war
was a man few people have ever heard of, the
Special Operations Executive’s (SOE’s) Ronald 
Seth, who was parachuted into Estonia to

fraction was of such value that nations
begrudged not a life nor a pound, rouble,
dollar or Reichsmark expended in securing it.

Until late 1942 the wartime SIGINT
competition was much less lopsided in the
Allies’ favour than legend suggests. Hitler had
his own Bletchley Parks, and the Germans
broke important codes, with consequences
for both the battle of the Atlantic and the
north African campaign. Admiral Karl
Dönitz’s men achieved reasonably regular
breaks into convoy communications, though
fortunately only about one signal in 10 was 
broken quickly enough to concentrate
U-boats on targets. A secret postwar
American study of German naval intelligence
concluded: “The enemy possessed at all times
a reasonably clear picture of Atlantic convoys
with varying degrees of accuracy as to the
routes and day-by-day plotting.”

Such failures sometimes had perverse
consequences. Dönitz several times became
fearful that the British were reading U-boat
codes, and ordered inquiries. In the end,
however, he allowed himself to be reassured
by the vulnerability of the Allies’ convoy
traffic. He reasoned that if the Royal Navy was
clever enough to read the German hand, its
chiefs would have stopped this costly hole in
their own communications.

Had the Allies’ conduct in the battle of the
Atlantic suggested omniscience, Dönitz
would almost certainly have suspected the
British breakthroughs in deciphering his
encrypted communications, and slammed
shut the window on U-boat operations that 

start a resistance movement in October 1942.
Seth was next sighted in Paris in 1944, having
become a protégé of German intelligence,
trained to drop back into Britain. This
fabulously weird man’s doings fill a thousand
pages in the files of SOE, MI6, MI5, MI9 and
Hitler’s Abwehr (military intelligence). It
almost defies belief that Seth’s operational
codename was ‘Blunderhead’.

In my new book, as in all my books, I have
attempted to paint the big picture – in this
case, the significance of intelligence to each
nation’s war effort – then woven in human
stories such as these about spies, codebreak-
ers, guerrillas and intelligence chiefs. The
Second World War witnessed an explosion of 
covert operations such that, in Professor
Richard Aldrich’s words, “secret service
became the struggle’s growth industry”.
Never in history had such vast resources been
lavished upon garnering information. The
Americans alone spent half a billion dollars  
a year on SIGINT – signals intelligence. 

Harnessing civilian talent
Most of this was wasted, of course, but today
we are in no doubt that the western Allies did
intelligence better than their enemies, partly
because they gave free rein to superb civilian
talent. When the British official history began
to be published 30 years ago, I suggested to its
author, Harry Hinsley, a veteran of the
codebreaking unit at Bletchley Park, that it
seemed to show amateurs achieving much
more than secret service professionals.
Hinsley replied, rather testily: “Of course they
did. You wouldn’t want to think, would you,
that in peacetime the best brains of our
society wasted their lives in intelligence?”

I’ve always thought this important. Battles
could be fought by men of limited gifts, the
virtues of the sports field: fitness, grit, skill
with weapons. But intelligence services
suddenly needed brilliance – and Britain was 
the place where they got more of it than
anywhere else.

Most books on this theme focus on single
nations. I have tried instead to explore the
global story. I’ve written a lot about the
Soviets, whose doings are unfamiliar to most
western readers, and who created the largest
spy networks the world has ever seen, across
continental Europe and in Britain and the US.

The ‘Red Orchestra’, upper-middle-class,
leftwing Germans, provided Moscow with
superb intelligence about Hitler’s war machine
between 1935 and 1942. They were led by
astonishing personalities: the Luftwaffe officer
Harro Schulze-Boysen and his wife Libertas,
the intellectual Arvid Harnack and his
American wife Mildred, all four of whom
eventually met dreadful deaths at Nazi hands.

Spymasters were often unsure which side 

Admiral Karl Dönitz talks to a U-boat commander in December 1944. Interception of Allied
messages aided German attacks – but also masked British success in breaking German ciphers

their agents were really on, and in some cases
doubt persists to this day. The British dwell
obsessively on the treason of the so-called
Cambridge Five. But fewer people notice what
we might call the Washington and Berkeley
500 – a small army of American leftists who
briefed Soviet intelligence not merely about
the atomic bomb but also about every aspect
of US policy and technology.

Many books about intelligence focus on
what spies and codebreakers found out. The
only question that matters, however, is of how
far their discoveries changed outcomes. Did
they prompt action by commanders in the
field and at sea? It is fruitless to study in
isolation any nation’s pearls of revelation.
These must be seen in the context of thou-
sands of pages of trivia and nonsense that
crossed the desks of analysts and warlords.

I am struck by the number of spies whose
only achievement abroad was to stay alive, at
hefty cost to their employers, while collecting
information of which not a smidgen assisted
anyone’s war effort. Perhaps one-thousandth
of 1 per cent of material from secret sources 
changed battlefield outcomes. Yet that

helped decipher messages encrypted using
German Enigma machines – gained open
access to the enemy’s communications. This is
untrue. The codebreakers didn’t walk on all
the water all the time. Though a lot of
Luftwaffe and naval traffic was read from
1941 onwards, breaking army Enigma messages
was hugely difficult. As late as September
1944, Hut 6 at Bletchley could read only 15 per
cent of army messages. Many breaks took
days to achieve, and reached battlefield
commanders too late to influence events.

Moreover, an increasing number of the
Germans’ most secret messages were enci-
phered not with Enigma, but instead through
teleprinters that employed an entirely different
system. The achievement of Bletchley’s people
in cracking this system was arguably greater
than that of breaking Enigma. The most
widely used German teleprinter was the
Lorenz Schlüsselzusatz (SZ) – codenamed
Tunny at Bletchley – which transmitted in a
non-Morse language. After British intercep-
tors started to record this incomprehensible
stutter, from August 1941 a Bletchley team
probed its significance.

Piece by piece they groped towards the
solution of the Lorenz riddle, handicapped by
the lack of a physical example of the Germans’
transmitter (whereas they had had an Enigma
machine). The man who made the initial
discoveries is scarcely known to posterity, yet
deserves to be almost as famous as Turing.

Bill Tutte was a 24-year-old former
chemistry student turned mathematician. The
son of a gardener, he won a scholarship to the 

This Abwehr G312 Enigma machine, now on
display at Bletchley Park, was used to encrypt
messages between German armed forces

had been prised open by the brilliant
codebreakers of Bletchley Park.

As for the land war, until late 1942 German
and Allied SIGINT were in about the same
place. The Afrika Korps thought the British
8th Army’s wireless discipline very slack, and
attributed to this some of Rommel’s tri-
umphs. The so-called ‘Desert Fox’ called the
Wehrmacht’s 621st Radio Interception
Company his ‘circus’, and it was deemed a
major disaster when in July 1942 New
Zealanders overran and destroyed it. Worse
for Rommel, at about the same time,
Washington belatedly changed its diplomatic
codes. For many months, he had been reading
what he gratefully called his ‘little Fellers’ –
the dispatches of Colonel Bonner Fellers, the
American military attaché in Cairo, who
revealed almost every detail about British
deployments and intentions.

After Bletchley persuaded the Americans
to repair this gaping security breach, the
Germans never again secured such a superb
source. For the rest of the war they read
only lower Allied codes, though spasms of
carelessness enabled the Germans to piece
together orders of battle, just as the British and
Americans did with German communiqués.

The Wehrmacht out-station in Athens, for
instance, once read a message from a British
paymaster in Palestine, instructing a division 
moving to Egypt to leave behind its filing
cabinets. This enabled a big red pin to be
shifted on the map of Montgomery’s deploy-
ments. Later, the Germans discovered that the
American 82nd Airborne division had been
redeployed from Italy to Britain because they
broke an administrative message about a
paratrooper facing a paternity suit. They also
deduced an impending attack in Italy when
they decrypted a signal ordering a rum issue 
for the assault units.

Bletchley’s brilliance
We should acknowledge that German
codebreakers achieved important successes
– before thanking our forefathers’ lucky stars
that they did not, in the end, match the men
and women of the Government Code and
Cypher School outside a dreary suburban
town in Buckinghamshire: Bletchley Park.

Alan Turing was in a class of his own. Yet
the Bletchley Park story is far more compli-
cated than such simplistic films as The
Imitation Game suggest. First, far from
anybody at Bletchley persecuting Turing, his
genius was always recognised there. Second,
the GCCS’s achievement was a team effort by
one of the most remarkable groups of human
beings ever assembled – Turing could have
achieved nothing without that fellowship.

Legend has it that Bletchley, through Turing’s
Bombes – electro-mechanical machines that 

Cambridge and County Day School, then
progressed to Trinity College. In October
1941, Tutte was assigned to study Lorenz, and
spent months seeking to divine what kind of
machine might generate the noises recorded
by the interceptors. By sheer brainpower he
eventually established that the teleprinter had
two sets of five wheels, with 501 settable pins
and a further two motor wheels, between
them creating a range of combinations much
greater than Enigma’s. A Bletchley chief hailed
Tutte’s contribution as “one of the outstanding 
successes of the war” – and so it was. 

Fishing for information
Establishing the machine’s character was a
vital beginning, yet the problems of reading
its traffic remained huge. By the summer of
1942, the need to crack Lorenz had become
desperately urgent. The more the Germans
used it for top-secret communications, the
less they used Enigma. Between July and
October 1942, by extraordinary endeavours
that owed little to mechanical assistance,
a Bletchley team read some messages. It was
learned that one of the teleprinters was named
Sägefisch (sawfish), so different German keys
used in setting Lorenz were allocated fish
codenames at Bletchley – Bream, Grilse,
Octopus and so on. Some of the most
momentous German messages were
encrypted in Jellyfish.

Bletchley reported in August 1943: “The
quality of the intelligence derived from the
Fish keys is of the highest order.” Decryption
attempts became far more successful towards
the end of the year, when new technology –
first, the ‘Heath Robinson’, then Colossus –
was deployed.

Decrypts from both Enigma and Lorenz
were known indiscriminately to Allied field
commanders as Ultra, and these enabled
them to plan operations in the second half of
the war with a confidence vouchsafed to no
previous warlords in history. But it deserves
emphasis that, though Ultra was a marvellous
tool, it was not an Excalibur, magicking
victories. Reading an enemy’s hand did not
diminish its strength. Until late 1942, again
and again the British learned where the
Germans intended to strike, but it did not
save them from losing the battles that
followed. Hard power was always indispens-
able to the exploitation of secret knowledge.

The British have always been justly proud
of their deception successes, but others also 
played this game, notably the Soviets,
sometimes with awesome success. Ian
Fleming’s thrillers are said to bear no
relationship to the real world of espionage.
Yet, when reading contemporary commissars’ 
reports and memoirs, I am struck by how
uncannily they echo the mad, monstrous,

imagined dialogue of such people in From
Russia With Love. Some of the plots executed
by Stalin’s spymasters were no less fantastic
than Fleming’s, and dwarf in scale those of
the western Allies.

For instance, in December 1941 a person-
able young man named Alexander
Demyanov, descendant of a great noble
family, skied into the German lines south-
west of Moscow and announced that he
represented a pro-Hitler resistance group
committed to restoring the tsars. The Abwehr
embraced him, and a few months later
parachuted him back into Russia, codenamed
Agent Max. Demyanov soon reported that
he had become a wireless operator at Red
Army headquarters and, for more than
two years thereafter, passed fabulous 
information to Berlin.

Stalin’s pivotal deception
Colonel Reinhard Gehlen, chief of German
intelligence on the eastern front, cherished
Max as his star source. Meanwhile, the spy’s
dispatches found another fascinated audience
– in Britain. Hugh Trevor-Roper, later
a controversial Oxford historian, spent the
war monitoring the Abwehr for MI6. During
my research I decided that the snobbish, rude,
arrogant Trevor-Roper was one of the most
remarkable British intelligence officers of the
war. From 1942 onwards he knew more about
Hitler’s secret services than anybody in
Germany, because he was privy to the
identities of all of the double agents controlled
by the Twenty Committee (so named as a nod
to that number in Roman numerals: XX –
‘double-cross’) in London.

Courtesy of Bletchley, the donnish officer
pored over Agent Max’s early dispatches – and
warned the Soviets they had a security leak the
size of the Grand Canyon. When they took no
notice, Trevor-Roper decided that Max must
be a double, controlled by Stalin’s NKVD.

In November 1942 came Stalingrad and
operation Uranus, the Soviets’ devastatingly
successful double-envelopment of the
German 6th Army. Around the same time
further north, the Red Army also launched
another big offensive, Operation Mars –
which proved a bloodstained failure.

This caused the British to conclude that
Agent Max could not conceivably be working
for Moscow – because he had warned the
Germans that Mars was coming, enabling
them to shift reinforcements northwards to
meet it. Nobody, reasoned these rational men
serving a western democracy, could have
sacrificed 77,000 Soviet lives to promote
a deception. But Stalin did just that. The
evidence now seems incontrovertible: that
Agent Max was indeed the NKVD’s Agent
Heine; and that, on the Soviet warlord’s 

personal authority, the Germans were told of
Operation Mars to distract them from
Uranus. This was surely one of the most
remarkable intelligence stories of the war.

Many things about the 1939–45 era remain
disputable, but no informed person doubts
that Bletchley was one of the most remarkable
institutions the world has ever known,
forming a key part of the narrative of Britain’s
achievement in the conflict. It remains
nonetheless weird, almost beyond imagining,
that the Germans never recognised the
vulnerability of Enigma and Lorenz. They
received endless clues and tips: in my book
I tell the story of how, in May 1942, a German
commerce raider seized the Australian
freighter Nankin, and found aboard top secret
Allied reports based on Ultra intercepts,
which were eventually forwarded to Berlin.
And in 1943 a Swiss intelligence officer,
exploiting a warning apparently from an
American source, told the Abwehr that the
Allies had broken the U-boat codes.

Even then, a most un-Germanic mental
laziness prevailed. While the Third Reich
executed wholesale Allied spies, traitors and
saboteurs, its functionaries remained
oblivious of the most deadly of all threats
to its security – a few hundred tweedy,
bespectacled young academics labouring in
drab, suburban Buckinghamshire. The only
explanation is hubris: an institutional
unwillingness to believe that their British
enemies, whom they so often humbled on

the battlefield, could be that clever.
Although there are many stories in my book

about bungles and failures, in intelligence as in
everything else related to conflict, victory is
won not by the side that makes no mistakes,
but by the one that makes fewer than the
enemy. By such a reckoning, the final triumph
of the British and Americans was as great in
the secret war as it became in the collision
between armies, navies and air forces.

We should also acknowledge that, for many
agents serving their countries abroad, the
experience was irresistibly thrilling, albeit at
risk of their lives. An SOE officer posted to the
Levant described the impact on local listeners
when he used the French word intelligence to
describe his mission: “The sharp intake of
breath by Arabs who had read their romans
policiers, and knew the omnipotence,
omniscience and ruthlessness of the British
Secret Service, was flatteringly audible. Some
instantly asked me if I was a lord.” He loved it.
So, too, did most other spies of many nations.
Why else would they have taken the work?

Ancient Egypt

From pyramids to mummies and Cleopatra to 

Tutankhamun, Egyptologist Joann Fletcher 

reveals the latest discoveries and controversies 

surrounding the ancient civilisation

Accompanies the forthcoming BBC Two series Immortal Egypt

The pictures 
carved into the 
sandstone cliffs at 
Qurta are domi-
nated by  
depictions of 
aurochs – now-
extinct wild cattle 
– dating back 
19,000 years

THE BIG QUES

The oldest graphic activity ever recorded in 
Egypt – indeed, in the whole of north Africa 
– was carved into the sandstone cliffs of 
Qurta around 25 miles south of Edfu, 
between Luxor and Aswan. Recently 
scientifically dated at 19,000 years old by 
Dr Dirk Huyge, director of the Belgian 
Mission who has studied the site since 
2005, the gallery comprises at least 185 
individual images, almost three-quarters of 
which depict the now-extinct, powerfully 
built wild cattle known as aurochs, the 
ancestors of domestic cows. 

Some of these huge creatures – almost  
2 metres long – have ‘cut’ marks scratched 
around the head and neck area. Huyge 
believes that these ‘cuts’ have some kind 
of symbolical meaning, possibly as an 
attempt to ensure a successful outcome 
for hunting expeditions. The Qurta scenes 
also feature hippos, gazelle, birds, fish  
and strange hybrid beings, along with 
several stylised female figures representing 
the earliest Egyptian attempts at  
self-portraits. 

Huyge has dubbed the rich repertoire  
of scenes a veritable “Lascaux along the 
Nile”, observing that these lifelike and vivid 
images are “uncannily close” in style to 
European cave art such as that seen at 
Lascaux in France, which also features 
aurochs and other large animals. He adds 

that “perhaps direct influence or cultural 
exchange over such a long distance is not as 
improbable as it seems… The Mediterranean 
Sea at the time of the last Ice Age was at least 
100 metres lower than it is now: could it be 
that Palaeolithic people established an 
intercontinental exchange of iconographic 
and symbolic concepts?”

The famous gold death 
mask of Tutankhamun 
was discovered in 
tomb KV62 by Howard 
Carter and his team – 
but was it originally 
made for Nefertiti?

Though undeniably Egypt’s most famous 
pharaoh, little is known about Tutankha-
mun. When born, probably around 1346 
BC at the city of Amarna, some 180 miles 
south of modern Cairo, he was named 
Tutankhaten – ‘Living Image of [sun god] 
Aten’. His father was the so-called heretic 
pharaoh Akhenaten, while his mother may 
have been Kiya, one of Akhenaten’s minor 
wives, or possibly even Akhenaten’s chief 
wife and co-ruler Nefertiti. 

Tutankhaten took the throne at his 
father’s death in c1336 BC, changing his 
name to the more familiar Tutankhamun 
when the Aten cult was terminated and 
worship of the state god Amun reinstated. 

He ruled until his death in c1327 BC, the 
cause of which remains a focus of debate. 
Studies of Tutankhamun’s tomb and its 
contents also continue to reveal all 
manner of unexpected details. Not least is 
the possibility that at least 80 per cent of 
his grave goods were originally made for 
other members of his family, from the 
famous gold throne to at least one of his 
three golden coffins. Even the gold death 
mask “had originally been a Nefertiti piece”, 
claims Egyptologist Nicholas Reeves.

Who was the real 
Tutankhamun?2

Ancient Egypt

Mummification is so synonymous with 
ancient Egypt that most people assume it  
has been completely understood for some 
time. Yet recent research is rewriting much  
of what was previously known – from the 
most effective techniques used during the 
14th century BC ‘New Kingdom’ to the 
preservatives that were used to obtain the 
most lifelike results. 

The origins of embalming are now known to 
be much earlier than the Pyramid Age (from 
c2600 BC). Well before that time, linen was 
used to wrap bodies at sites such as 
Mostagedda (north of Luxor), some of it 
coated in a toffee-like substance. But only in 
2014 was this substance finally identified, by 
archaeological chemist Dr Stephen Buckley 
of the University of York, as a blend of oils, 
fats and antibacterial pine resin. He discov-
ered that “some of the ingredients were 
brought from the north-east Mediterranean. 
For example, the pine resin must have come 
from what is now south-eastern Turkey.” 

But such long-distance trade links were not 
the only big surprise. Carbon dating carried 
out on the Mostagedda linen by researchers 
at the University of Oxford revealed that the 
wrappings and mixtures both date to c4300 
BC – some 1,700 years earlier than mummifi-
cation was previously believed to have first 
been used in Egypt. 

When were dead bodies 
first mummified?

It is estimated that 138 pyramids survive 
in Egypt, varying widely in layout, size, 
location and purpose. The first was built 
in c2650 BC for King Djoser. His bench-
shaped ‘mastaba’ tomb was embellished 
to form a six-tiered, 60 metre-high step 
pyramid (shown below). Snefru (c2613–
c2589 BC), the greatest of all Egypt’s 
pyramid builders, moved 9 million tonnes 
of stone to build three successive 
pyramids as he refined his plans, and his 
son Khufu created the Great Pyramid of 
Giza. This was the standard royal tomb till 
superseded in c1750 BC by rock-cut 
tombs such as those in Luxor’s Valley of 
the Kings. Some smaller pyramids are 
believed to have served as territorial 
markers or tax-collecting points; these
were built throughout the Nile Valley as
f h A i d 2600 BC

How many  
pyramids are there?

The deceptively simple-looking picture
writing evolved over several millennia into a
sophisticated system using thousands of 
signs. First described as hieroglyphs 
(‘sacred carvings’) by the Greeks, they were 
largely used to create the ritual texts 
covering the walls of temples and tombs, 
while a form of hieroglyphic shorthand 
known as ‘hieratic’ was used by the literate 
elite. These were mainly the scribes and 
officials who administered the country for 
the king, even before Egypt emerged as the 
world’s first nation state in c3100 BC.

German archaeologists excavating the 
tombs of Egypt’s earliest rulers at Abydos in 

the late 1980s discovered some 150 small
labels of bone, ivory and wood carved with
simple pictograms – ‘proto-hieroglyphs’ – 
describing everything from bolts of linen to 
jars of oil, together with their quantity and 
place of origin. 

The labels, once attached to grave goods, 
have been dated to c3250 BC and are the 
earliest evidence for the way officials raised 
and recorded taxes in kind. They are among 
the most important documents in history, as 
the pictograms form a phonetically readable 
script that some claim was the earliest 
writing in the world – apparently predating 
that of the Sumerians of Mesopotamia. 

Why did hieroglyphs develop?

far south as Aswan in around 2600 BC.

Intricately carved hieroglyphs at the ‘White Chapel’ of Senusret I  
at Karnak (c1950 BC). Did hieroglyphs evolve from early tax records?

This is perhaps the question most often
asked of Egyptologists – and the answer
is a resounding yes!

Some of the most exciting discoveries
are being made in museums. Last year
museum staff in Wigan, combining their
collections in new storage facilities,
rediscovered antiquities covering the
entire span of Egypt’s ancient history,
from c3500 BC to the early centuries AD,
the highlight being a gilded face from an
18th-dynasty coffin. Also last year, a
re-examination of ancient linen wrap-
pings from Mostagedda stored in Bolton
Museum pushed back the origins of
mummification by 1,700 years (see
opposite). Even the British Museum still
produces surprises. In 2012, computed
tomography (CT) scans revealed that the
naturally mummified body of a man –
known to generations of schoolchildren
as ‘Ginger’, thanks to his faded red hair
– had literally been stabbed in the back
around 3500 BC.

In Egypt itself, of course, new finds are
announced almost every week. Even the
Valley of the Kings has not yet been
completely explored. Nor, it seems, has
its most famous tomb. In 2014, high-
resolution scans of the walls of Tutankha-
mun’s burial chamber revealed the
outlines of two intact sealed doorways.
Some experts believe these may lead to
additional unexplored chambers.

So, much like the iconic golden death
mask, even the tomb of Tutankhamun
still conceals secrets.

Cleopatra VII ‘the Great’ was the last
pharaoh of the Ptolemaic dynasty (305–30
BC). The Macedonian king Alexander the
Great had taken Egypt in 332 BC during his
conquest of the Persian empire; on his
death, Ptolemy I – one of Alexander’s
generals and rumoured half-brother – took
control. His descendants – 15 male
pharaohs, all called Ptolemy – shared the

throne with female co-rulers. Cleopatra VII
ruled first with her father, then her brothers
and finally her son (by Julius Caesar)
Ptolemy XV, called Caesarion.

Though the Ptolemies initially spoke
Greek and clung to Greek culture, they
gradually became influenced by Egypt’s
ancient traditions. In 181 BC Ptolemy V
was mummified rather than cremated,
and Ptolemy VIII married one of his
d ht i t th Egyptian nobility.

The remains of the earliest human yet
found in Egypt were discovered by Belgian
archaeologists in 1994 during their
excavation of a Stone Age quarry at
Taramsa Hill near Dendera, about 40 miles
north of Luxor. They unexpectedly
uncovered the shallow pit grave of a young
child. Its body was carefully buried in a
seated position, oriented east toward the
rising sun, with its head resting back on
a sand bed to face skyward. The child, who
lived during the late Pleistocene, approxi-
mately 60,000–55,000 years ago, was

aged between 8 and 10 when it died, though
the remains were so fragile and fragmen-
tary that it was impossible to determine
whether they were male or female.

Not only is this the oldest known burial

vital missing link in the human story. As the
anthropologists who examined the child’s

find is significant, because it’s on a
possible dispersion route of modern
humans from Africa into Asia and Europe
between 50,000 and 100,000 years ago.”

n 1536 a young woman lay in the
Tower of London under sentence of
death. Her crime was to fall in love –
treason in the eyes of King
Henry VIII, who believed that her
lover had designs on his throne.

This wasn’t Anne Boleyn, who
famously lost her head that year, but the king’s
near heiress, Lady Margaret Douglas, who
had secretly precontracted herself to Lord
Thomas Howard, half-brother of the Duke of
Norfolk. The Act of Attainder passed against
Thomas was the first ever to legislate on royal
marriages, and decreed that any man
espousing or defiling a relative of the king,
without royal assent, was a traitor – and both
would suffer death. Thus Margaret and
Thomas stood condemned under a statute
that had not been in force when they had
committed what was now, legally, an offence.

Margaret Douglas was a great prize, for she
had a strong claim to the throne of England.
Tudor blood ran in her veins: her mother,
Margaret Tudor, Queen of Scots, was
Henry VIII’s sister. Margaret was courted
and feared accordingly.

The story of her extraordinary life spans
five Tudor reigns, and is packed with intrigue,
drama and tragedy. In an age of female
inferiority, she stands out as a feisty, intelli-
gent character who operated effectively at the
highest levels of power.

Margaret’s birth was as dramatic as her life.
In 1515, ousted from the Scottish regency, a
pregnant Margaret Tudor fled into
Northumberland, finding refuge at Harbottle
Castle. Her daughter was born there, two
weeks prematurely, on 7 October. Henry VIII
had no children, and English law did not
recognise the claim of the Scottish James V, so
Margaret Douglas was Henry’s next heir after
her mother.

Margaret’s childhood was overshadowed by
her warring parents. By 1518 her father,
Archibald Douglas, Earl of Angus was living
in adultery and, after they divorced, he took
custody of young Margaret. In 1528, branded
a traitor, he fled with her to England.

Margaret was growing into a spirited young
lady, “both beautiful and highly esteemed”, as
one contemporary put it. In 1531 Henry
placed her in the household of his daughter,

Lady of honour to Anne Boleyn, grandmother to a king: Margaret 

Douglas’s life was intimately connected to the Tudor period.  

So why is she so little known? Alison Weir explores her story

Katherine Parr and returned to court.  
On 6 July 1544, Margaret was married to 

Matthew Stuart, Earl of Lennox, an ambi-
tious, French-educated, Scottish nobleman 
who had turned traitor by offering his 
allegiance to Henry VIII. It was a political 
union, but the couple fell in love and 
remained devoted to each other. 

While Lennox was away campaigning, 
Margaret bore his children. They had eight: 
four boys and four girls. The only two to 
survive into adulthood were Henry, Lord 
Darnley, born in 1545, and Charles, born in 
1557. Margaret doted on her sons, and was 
the dominating influence in their lives. 

But a malign influence had entered her 
world: Lennox’s secretary, Thomas Bishop, a 
treacherous mischief-maker. His ill-feeling 
seems to have sprung from Margaret 
complaining about him to her husband and 
urging his dismissal. In time Bishop would 
exact a vicious revenge. 

In 1547 Henry VIII died. Margaret lived in 
Yorkshire for most of Edward VI’s reign, but 
was in Scotland in 1553 at the time of his 
death and the unsuccessful coup to place 
Lady Jane Grey on the throne. She hastened 
home for the coronation of her friend, Mary 
Tudor, and it is at this point that Margaret 
emerges as a staunch Catholic, like the queen. 

Mary wanted Margaret to succeed her 
instead of the Protestant Elizabeth. She gave 
Margaret precedence over Elizabeth at public 
ceremonies, and treated her as her next heir. 
But parliament would not sanction it and, 
when Mary died in 1558, it was Elizabeth 
who succeeded. Yet Margaret, as a Catholic, 
would remain a dynastic threat and prove a 
powerful force in Elizabethan politics. 

A blessing and a curse
Elizabeth’s councillors feared that Margaret 
would make a bid for the crown. But 
Margaret’s aims reached further. She had 
brought up Lord Darnley in the Roman faith 
and had him well educated. Like her, he had a 
sound claim to the throne, and she was 
fiercely ambitious for him. But he was an 
arrogant boy, stupid and spoilt. 

Margaret secretly plotted to marry Darnley 
to the young Mary, Queen of Scots, which 
would unite two Catholic claims to the

the Princess Mary. Two years later, Margaret 
was one of the ladies of honour assigned to 
Anne Boleyn, a role she would hold under all 
of Henry’s successive wives.

Anne presided over a lively circle of 
courtiers who enjoyed much “pastime in the 
queen’s chamber”, making music, dancing 
and writing poetry. The poems they wrote 
were bound into books and circulated at 
court; one, the Devonshire Manuscript, 
comprised verses composed or transcribed by 
Margaret, and her friends Mary Howard, 
Duchess of Richmond and Mary Shelton, 
Anne Boleyn’s cousin. These poems chart the 
doomed romance between Margaret and 
Thomas Howard. Precontracting herself 
without royal assent shows Margaret as 
headstrong and reckless – character traits that 
would be evident throughout her adult life. 

Doomed romance
By October 1537 the couple were grievously 
ill. Margaret was freed from the Tower but 
Thomas, tragically, died. Devastated and 
weak, Margaret was sent to Syon Abbey to 
recuperate. She was still mourning her lost 
lover a year later. 

Yet she failed to learn from this terrible 
experience. In 1541 she again incurred 
Henry’s displeasure after involving herself in 
an affair with Charles Howard, brother of the 
doomed queen Catherine Howard. This time 
she was fortunate to escape with a repri-
mand. She spent the next two years at 
Kenninghall, the Duke of Norfolk’s house.  
In 1543 she attended Henry’s wedding to

throne of England, and bring the two
kingdoms under Stuart rule. Yet she was
unaware that spies were watching her every
movement. One of those informers was the
malevolent Thomas Bishop.

When Elizabeth found out about
Margaret’s plotting, she kept her under house
arrest for more than a year and sent Lennox
to the Tower. In 1563 both were released, but
Margaret continued to scheme, and when, in
1565, Darnley wed Mary without Elizabeth’s
permission, Margaret once again ended up in
the Tower. She stayed there for two years
until Darnley was murdered, whereupon
she collapsed in such violent paroxysms of
grief that, out of compassion, Elizabeth set
her at liberty.

Margaret demanded vengeance on
Darnley’s murderers. She denounced Mary,
insisting that she had connived at Darnley’s
destruction. She and Lennox were ceaseless,
and vocal, in their quest for justice.

In 1567 Mary was forced to abdicate in
favour of her infant son, who was crowned
James VI of Scots. Margaret had now realised
her ambition of being grandmother to a king,
and was to dedicate herself to young James’s 
interests for the rest of her life. In 1570
Lennox was appointed regent for his
grandson, but his alleged sympathies for the
English made him an unpopular figure and,
in 1571, he was assassinated. Margaret was
once more plunged into grief.

In 1574 Margaret intrigued with the
redoubtable noblewoman Bess of Hardwick
to marry her son Charles to Bess’s daughter.
It was probably on his mother’s instructions
that Charles so “entangled himself that he
could have none other”, and Margaret and
Bess hastened the marriage – crucially,
without seeking the queen’s permission.
Elizabeth I was incandescent – and Margaret
suffered a third spell in the Tower.

After Charles’s death from tuberculosis in 
1576, she fought in vain to secure for his
daughter Arbella the earldom of Lennox,
which had reverted to James VI.

on 9 March 1578, Margaret, aged 62. The Earl
of Leicester’s opponents often circulated
rumours that he poisoned his enemies – and
some blamed him for Margaret’s death. But
she probably succumbed to a heart attack or
stroke. She was buried in the tomb that she
had built for herself in Westminster Abbey.

Given her intrigues, her closeness to the
throne, and Elizabeth’s enmity, it is surpris-
ing that Margaret Douglas lived so long. She
had spent four years in the Tower, “not for
matters of treason, but for love matters”. Love
had been the great blessing and the great
curse of her life.

Her royal blood had brought danger and
tragedy, for it had fuelled her ambition to
secure a crown for her descendants. But she
managed to retain her position at court – a
lucky survivor in the brutal world of
16th-century politics – and she died in her
bed, not by the axe as did Lady Jane Grey or
Mary, Queen of Scots, or in prison like Jane’s
sister Lady Katherine Grey. That may well be 
why Margaret Douglas, a prominent and
crucially important figure in Tudor England,
is largely forgotten and overlooked.

Margaret did not live to see her dynastic
ambitions brought to fruition. How she
would have exulted to see her grandson
ascend the English throne as James I, uniting
the kingdoms of England and Scotland under
one ruler. It was what she had hoped and
schemed for all her life. And it is her blood,
not that of Henry VIII or her rival
Elizabeth I, that has flowed in the veins 
of every sovereign since. 

THE LIFE OF A 

LOST PRINCESS

1515
Margaret is born at Harbottle Castle, 

Northumberland. Because she is born in 
England, she is her uncle Henry VIII’s 

subject, and as such has a strong claim 
to the throne. 

1527
Margaret’s parents,

Archibald Douglas, Earl
of Angus, and Margaret

Tudor (right) divorce,
which raises enduring

questions about  
Margaret’s legitimacy.

1530
She arrives at the English court, where she 
is treated as a princess of the blood. She 

will serve five of Henry VIII’s wives. 

1536–37
Margaret secretly precontracts herself to 
Lord Thomas Howard. Both are impris-

oned in the Tower. Margaret is released, 
but Thomas dies of an illness.  

1544
Margaret marries Matthew Stuart, Earl 

of Lennox. It is a love match.

1562–63
Margaret is kept under house arrest at 
Sheen for plotting to marry her son, Lord 

Darnley, to Mary, Queen of Scots.  

1565–67
Margaret is again imprisoned in the 
Tower after Darnley (left) marries 
Mary without Elizabeth I’s consent. 
Compassion prompts Elizabeth to 
elease her after Darnley’s murder.

1571
Margaret’s husband, the Earl of Lennox, is 
assassinated in Scotland after a turbulent 
regency for their grandson, James VI.

1574–75
Margaret schemes to marry her son 
Charles Stuart to Bess of Hardwick’s 
daughter Elizabeth Cavendish. For this, 
she is once again sent to the Tower, but 

remains there for only a few weeks. 

1578
Margaret dies at her house at Hackney, 

and is accorded a state funeral and 
buried in Westminster Abbey.

Books / Interview

ANDREA WULF
Brought up in Germany, Wulf studied design history at the Royal College of Art  

in London. She has written for publications including The New York Times and  

the Guardian, and her previous books include The Brother Gardeners: A Generation 

of Gentlemen Naturalists and the Birth of an Obsession (Vintage, 2008). She was the 

2013 British Library writer-in-residence in the Eccles Centre for American Studies.

Why did you write this biography?

I’m from Germany, where Alexander
von Humboldt is a big name – but very
few people have heard of him in the UK
or US. So I knew about him from when
I was younger, but then forgot about him.
Later, whenever I started a book, he kept
popping up because he was such a polymath
– he had his fingers in every pie.

He was the last of the polymaths, in
my opinion. When he died in 1859 it was
the last moment at which one person held
all the knowledge in their head that he did.
After that point, scientists begin to fall into
specialised fields of narrow expertise.

He also had an extraordinary memory:
he could remember the shape of a leaf,
or the colour of soil, across decades and
decades and distances of thousands of miles.
That’s why he was able to look at nature
as a global force, because he could remind
himself while he was in the Alps that he’d
seen something in the Andes, for instance.

Can we trace how Humboldt saw the

world back to when he was young?

To some extent. He was a typical child of
the Enlightenment, I’d say, brought up in
a very privileged and wealthy aristocratic
Prussian family. His father died when he
was young, and his mother was very cold,
emotionally, but what she did do was provided
a string of amazing Enlightenment teachers.

Where he was brought up was important
too. Tegel, the family estate, is set among
huge forests near Berlin. Unlike his brother
– who was very happy with books – Alexan-
der was always running around, coming
back with his pockets stuffed full of shells,
seeds, plants and insects.

So he was brought up within nature,
with Enlightenment ideas. And then he met
Johann Wolfgang Goethe, who at that time 
was Germany’s greatest poet. Humboldt
later said that it was almost as if Goethe
gave him new organs with which to view
the world. One of the extraordinary things
about Humboldt is that he straddled the
Enlightenment and Romanticism: he said
that we can only understand nature if we
look at it with reason and with our feelings,d
our emotions and our imagination.

How important was his ability  

to understand new technology?

I think it was incredibly important. We tend
to see historical figures in a romantic way
and yes, Humboldt really understood nature,
but he was also fascinated by all kinds of new
technology. One of the reasons it took him
so long to prepare for his expedition to
South America is that he wanted to buy the
best instruments he could. He travelled
around Europe to find apparatus, and then
took it to the experts to learn how to use it.
In the end he took 42 devices, schlepping
them over the Andes and down the Orinoco.

Did he enjoy the experience of 

travelling to South America?

Prussia was almost this intellectual corset
imposed on him, so I think he felt absolutely
liberated going to Latin America. He always
said that scientists had to leave their labs and
be outside in nature to understand it.

Most historians don’t want to touch this
subject, but he was probably gay, so this was
also a moment when he could just be who
he was without anyone checking up on him.
I think he expressed a lot of his frustration in
his personal life through physical exertion.
As he put it: “I don’t have sensual needs.”
Instead, he climbed mountains. What he did
physically is absolutely mind-blowing. His
team crossed the Andes again and again –

2,500 miles of one of the harshest landscapes
you could possibly imagine. By the time
they climbed Chimborazo, a volcanic moun-
tain in the Andes, Humboldt was the most
experienced mountaineer in the world. This
was not a scientist who sat in an ivory tower.

Of all the things that he saw in South 

America, which was most important?

I think it was the Chimborazo. This was the
moment when three years of travelling came
together for him. He climbed 20,000 feet,
almost to the top, of this mountain that was
believed to be the highest in the world. No
other person had been higher than he was.

Humboldt looked down and saw moun-
tain ranges folded below him, and realised
that the journey he’d taken from Quito in
Ecuador, about 100 miles away, had taken
him through tropical vegetation; through
alpine plants, moss and lichen, to the line
of eternal snow. And he understood that,
rather than seeing the plant world in terms
of classification, we should see it in terms of
vegetation zones. This was the moment that
he understood that nature is a global force.

The fascinating thing about Humboldt
is that he’s not primarily important for the
discovery of one thing: instead, he comes up
with a new view of the world. Throughout
his life he talked a lot about the glimpses you
have from above, the glimpses that show you
that everything comes together.

How did Humboldt develop his  

idea that everything is connected?

I think it was because he travelled so much.
As a young man he went all over Europe as 
a mining inspector, and then later he visited
the US and Siberia. At that time not many
people had seen so much, and they definitely 
weren’t scientists who could remember
everything they had ever seen!

It became very clear to Humboldt that
there were connections across the globe, 
and he became obsessed with taking
temperatures. Until then, this data had been
recorded in long tables, but he came up with
the extraordinary approach of drawing maps
of the world featuring isotherms – the lines
that we see on weather reports today, linking
parts of the world experiencing the same
temperature. When you look at the data like
that, everything becomes so much clearer.
I really think that we can see Humboldt as
the originator of comparative climatology.

the shape of a leaf,

or the colour of soil,

PROFI LE

Alexander von Humboldt
was born to a prominent family in Berlin
in September 1769. His mother planned
for him to work in finance, but following
her death Humboldt pursued his interest
in the natural world and embarked on an
expedition to Latin America. His scientific
observations of the area’s plant life led
him to develop theories of biogeography
that were to influence generations of later
experts, including Charles Darwin. Further
travels to North and South America saw
him interact with leading political figures
including Thomas Jefferson and Simon
Bolivar. He died in 1859 at the age of 89.

But if everything hangs together it can all
go wrong, because if you pull one thread the
whole thing might unravel. When Humboldt
was in South America he saw the devastating
environmental effects of monoculture,
irrigation and deforestation, and was the first
to predict harmful human climate change.
It’s amazing, because in 1832 he predicted
the three ways that humankind can destroy
the environment: through irrigation, the
felling of forests, and industrial emissions.

His work led to a lot of fame, didn’t it?

Yes, and as much as I adore Humboldt,
he was quite flawed. The more famous he
became, the harder he found it to under-
stand that he wasn’t the centre of attention.

There’s an amazing moment in 1842 when
Charles Darwin finally met Humboldt, who
was a huge hero for him, and the reason that
Darwin went on his scientific voyage on the
Beagle. And Darwin was utterly disappointed,
because he couldn’t get a word in. 

Despite this fame, Humboldt is now 

not that well known. Why is this?

The first reason is that he was a polymath, so
when he died – the point at which scientists
began to specialise – these ‘experts’ looked
down at him for knowing everything. They
saw it as making him an amateur, almost.

The other reason is that he was German.
He was famous until the First World War,
which was really not a great time in the UK 

or the US to celebrate a German scientist.
The United States, particularly, had been in
love with Humboldt, but during this period
they burned German books and renamed
streets originally titled in his honour.

What are Humboldt’s key legacies?

He gave us an idea of nature, as a web of life,
that continues to shape how we see it. His
interdisciplinary, holistic view is also hugely
important. We now have such a sharp line
between the sciences and arts, and I think
we could do with adopting his approach
of bringing together the subjective and
objective, of combining scientific curiosity 
with an emotional response to nature.

As a historian I think it’s really important
that we know where our roots are and what
our history is, and it seems to me that the
environmental movement is really lacking 
a historical, philosophical base on which
they can build. Humboldt’s ideas are now
so seemingly obvious that we’ve forgotten
the man behind them. I’d say a lot of nature
writers are still following in his footsteps –
even though they may never have heard of
him. If you think of something like Rachel
Carson’s 1962 book Silent Spring, she couldg
only have come up with the argument that
nature is an interconnected whole because
of Humboldt. He is the forgotten father of
environmentalism and of nature writing.

Most important, though, is the fact that he
predicted human-induced climate change.  

I think it’s time to remind ourselves that
this has been an issue for a very long time,
and is something that I believe we really
need to tackle – and, I’d argue, through
a Humboldtian approach. He believed in the
exchange of knowledge between the sciences, 
and that is incredibly important today.

If you could somehow travel back  

in time and ask Humboldt a question, 

what would it be?

I would ask him how we’re going to deal with
climate change. He was always so up-to-

date, so he would know 
what to do.

The German War: A Nation

Under Arms, 1939-1945

by Nicholas Stargardt
The Bodley Head, 736 pages, £25

In his study of
Germany in the final
year of Hitler’s war,
The End (Penguin,
2011), Sir Ian Kershaw
devotes much space
to speculating as to
why the vast majority
of the German people

continued to back the terrorist regime
that had failed them so disastrously un-

til the bitter end. In Nicholas Stargardt’s
massive, searching and eye-opening
investigation of the wider German
population’s attitudes to their rulers
and their crimes during the war, the
University of Oxford historian attempts
to find an answer to this conundrum.

Using an enormous array of sources,
including letters sent home by soldiers
from the front, trial testimonies, secret
diaries and the unvarnished views of
more intelligent and self-aware Nazi
ministers such as Josef Goebbels and
Albert Speer, Stargardt has embroi-
dered a vast tapestry portrait of
Germany on its high road to hell.

Like any good historian, Stargardt
is well aware of how deeply our vision of
the past is influenced by our contempo-
rary situation. He thus explains how,
in the immediate postwar period, when
the crying need of the west was for
a strong Germany to become a bulwark 
against Soviet communism in the
Cold War, the crimes of Nazism were
airbrushed away or blamed solely
on the SS. This allowed the Nazi
Wehrmacht to be absolved of atrocities,
given a clean bill of health, and reborn
as the squeaky-clean new Bundeswehr.

It was only in the 1990s, when an
exhibition about Wehrmacht war
crimes toured major German cities,
that it was it finally admitted that the
army had been up to its neck in Nazi
crimes, and that many soldiers on the
eastern front proudly carried photo-
graphs of them taking part in the mass
execution of Jewish people and partisans
along with their treasured family snaps.

Stargardt liberally quotes the diary
of officer August Topperwein, who,
after witnessing a massacre of a village’s
entire population of 300 Jews of “all ages
and both sexes”, belatedly realises that:
“We are not just destroying the Jews
who want to fight against us. We literally 
want to exterminate this people.”

Stargardt gives the lie to any idea that
ordinary Germans did not know about
the Holocaust. He repeatedly quotes
witnesses who saw what Goebbels
called the Allied ‘terror bombing’ of the
cities, and the mass rapes carried out by
the Soviet army, as a just punishment
for the original Nazi sin of deporting
and killing the country’s Jews.

Whereas Kershaw saw German
efficiency, and Nazi totalitarian
command and control, as keys to the
nation’s extraordinary resilience in
the face of hammer blows that would
have destroyed other peoples, Stargardt
shifts the emphasis to Nazi success in 

National solidarity?

Augustus: The Biography

by Jochen Bleicken
Allen Lane, 784 pages, £30

This is a superb  
account of the 
grand-nephew  
of Julius Caesar, 
Gaius Octavius. 
Born into a wealthy 
Italian family of no 
serious distinction 
in the small town  

of Velletrae, he became Octavianus 
when adopted (aged 18) by Caesar as  
his son and heir, and was to emerge  
as Rome’s first emperor, Augustus.

Jochen Bleicken argues that being 
Caesar’s heir meant nothing more than 
it did for the heir of any other aristo-
crat: it implied he had an advantageous 
foot on the political ladder, but what he 
made of it was up to him. After Caesar’s 
assassination in 44 BC, Cicero for one 
was not at all certain Octavian would 
become a ‘good citizen’, and few would 
have bet on him becoming master of 
the Roman world. 

Octavian began his political career 
when that world was in turmoil after 
Caesar’s death, with civil war ready  
to flare up again. Bleicken argues  
that Octavian came to understand that  
there was no 
future in the 
military 
dictatorship 
of the sort that 
Caesar had run. 
But since military 
dictatorship was all that 
was on offer among the old 
families who now lined up to 
fight over Caesar’s inheri-
tance (there was nothing 
‘revolutionary’ about those 
who assassinated Caesar), 
Octavian had to play that 
game. Absurdly young 
though he was, he showed 

himself a brilliant – and at times 
rather lucky – survivor in the ensuing 
lawless chaos, selecting and discarding 
friends and enemies as he saw fit, as 
willing to murder rivals as he was to 
show clemency. 

When he emerged victorious against 
Antony and Cleopatra in 31 BC, he had 
done so owing nothing to Rome’s inner-
ring of powerful ancient families. Free of 
that baggage, he set about creating a new 
state, which nodded to its republican 
past but whose basis was three-fold:  
a constitution legitimising one-man rule 
by the princeps (‘first man’); Rome’s first 
professional standing army under the 
princeps’ supreme command, stationed 
across the provinces; and the promo-
tion of new executive and administra-
tive talent wherever it could be found. 
Further, by replacing the republican 
culture of exploiting the provinces for 
private gain with responsible adminis-
tration, he established Rome as one of 
the world’s most successful empires.

When he died, his mix of patience, 
determination and ruthlessness had 
completely reconstructed the Roman 
world. It was an unparalleled, probably 
unique, personal achievement. 

Bleicken published the original 
German version of this book in 1998. 
Expertly translated by Anthea Bell, it 
combines fine scholarship and balanced 
argument with a clear, well-constructed 

storyline that does Bleicken’s subject 
proud. It should become standard 
reading for everyone interested  

in the foundations of the 
Roman empire.

“This book may 

change forever  

what we thought we 

knew about German 

responses to war”

throughout the second 20th-century 
war they had unleashed on the world 
remained bleak and grim. There was  
a brief blip following the early fall of 
France, when the looted food and  
wine led infantryman and farmer’s son  
Ernst Guicking to exult: “First pork leg,  
then roast calf, sausage with vegetables  
and to finish a wonderful dessert. We 
are living ‘Like God in France’.” Once  
the invasion of Russia became bogged 
down the following year, however,  
most thinking Germans realised that 
Hitler’s great gamble had failed, and 
that his war was irretrievably lost.

This masterly book may well change 
forever what we thought we knew  
about response of the German people to 
the war. They could not square the circle: 
the stubborn fact was they were fighting 
for their country, but in a war charac-
terised by cruel, callous and ultimately 
genocidal methods. In the end, it risked 
consuming not only their material 
resources but their humanity as well.

The Mistresses of Cliveden:

Three Centuries of Scandal,

by Natalie Livingstone
Hutchinson, 512 pages, £25

Scandalous women

been irresistible –  
not just in life but
in print. That’s
certainly true of
Cliveden’s mistresses
in this ambitious

biography of the opulent stately home.

Germany. The author Erich Kästner was
loitering discreetly in the crowd when his
books were denounced for contributing
to German’s ‘moral decline’. He recalled 
that he saw “books flying into the
roaring flames and heard the sentimen-
tal tirades of that slick little liar [Joseph
Goebbels]… It was revolting.”

The cultural shift represented in the
move from Betty Boop to Hitler Youth
was reflected in much larger changes in
interwar Europe and America. Yet
Philipp Blom argues that the ‘fracture’ in
western culture was neither so simple
nor so complete as these developments
might suggest.

Blom’s book is structured chronologi-
cally, with chapters devoted to each year
between 1918 and 1937 (1938 is there, but

The stories of five intriguing and very
different women are neatly framed by
the evolution of the house itself, from
its conception as a romantic country
hideaway for the Duke of Buckingham’s
lover in the 1660s, to its purchase as a
hotel by the author’s husband in 2012.

The “lustful, greedy” Anna Maria,
Countess of Shrewsbury, who captivated
Buckingham, made the most of her
charms but ultimately became Cliveden’s
lost mistress after a House of Lords
ruling forced the couple to separate in
1674. Her successor was equally adept in
the age-old trade of sex for wealth and
power but, as she was “crookedly built”

with a squint in one eye, it was personality
rather than beauty that drew Elizabeth,
Countess of Orkney into an affair with
William of Orange and consolidated
her role as influential society hostess.

A lack of surviving personal letters
means that both remain rather distant
figures, and the book is strongest in later
sections where the women’s own voices
are heard. Augusta, Princess of Wales
emerges as a lively character, enjoying
picnics and games of ninepin with
her children in the gardens.

In 1795 Cliveden burned to the
ground. The ruins were later restored
under the supervision of Harriet,
Duchess of Sutherland, an anti-slavery
campaigner and close friend of Queen
Victoria and William Gladstone. Most
familiar to readers will be the turbulent
saga of Nancy Astor, who sensibly ditched
another suitor to marry the “fourth

only as an odd, thin epilogue). This
sometimes leads to rather artificial links
between disparate events. More often, it 
allows for new and original insights. For 
example, Blom uses a discussion of
PG Wodehouse’s novel Thank You, Jeeves
(about a super-competent butler and his
foolish upper-class master) to reflect on 
class, poverty and protest in 1930s Britain.

It also enables Blom to draw attention
to less familiar events and individuals. 
His range is extraordinary: he evokes
dance, music, architecture and literature
with verve, and analyses politics,
economics and technology with great
clarity. People, rather than abstractions,
are at the heart of this story. Blom
reminds us of the “cheerful nihilism” of

became the first female MP to take a seat
at Westminster. It was at a party held by
Nancy’s son Bill that John Profumo met
Christine Keeler, and a scandal was born.

Fluently written, the book interweaves 
these personal stories with historical
snippets illuminating each era and
glimpses of life at the pinnacle of society
– from spectacular Restoration banquets 
featuring peacock, tortoise and glittering
crystal jellies, to the hazards of wearing
court dresses spiked with long pins.

Yet his approach has little in common
with Macaulay’s partisan Whig bombast.
High politics are recounted in dispas-
sionate journalistic terms. Charles VI’s
madness, and the greed of his courtiers,
lay behind the collapse of political order
in France. In England, Henry V’s genius
averted what might otherwise have been
an even sharper slide into chaos.

The crown of France remained too
potent a symbol to be brought low
even by the humiliations of Charles VI.
Dynastic fortunes would shortly be
reversed. After 1422, it was to be France
that held the winning hands, and the
English who found themselves lumbered
with a less than effective king. Winning
wars, meanwhile, involved more than
military success. Henry V may have
scored victories on the battlefield and
at the treaty table, but never won the 
hearts and minds of his subjects in
France. That a leading public figure
not only understands this fact, but is
prepared to teach it, is one of the many 
wonders of Sumption’s book.

This is one of the great historical
enterprises of our times, elegantly
constructed, thrillingly told, illuminat-
ing every incident and personality that
it touches. Nobody who loves history 
should pass it by unread.

The Hundred Years War,  

Volume IV: Cursed Kings  

by Jonathan Sumption
Faber and Faber, 928 pages, £40

On 23 November 1407,
riding home singing
after a long, well-lubri-
cated supper, the king
of France’s brother was
assassinated by agents
of his cousin John,
Duke of Burgundy.
On 10 September 1419,

John was violently murdered under the 
gaze of the French dauphin. These two
deaths plunged France into civil war. 

As a monk displaying John’s remains
is said to have remarked: “It was through
the hole in this skull that the English
entered France.” French politics dissolved
into factional rivalry. Henry V seized
the opportunity not only for short-lived 
victory at Agincourt, but to conquer
Normandy as far as the gates of Paris.  
Charles VI reigned in France, his long
periods of madness interrupted by brief
remissions from which, like a malignant
jack-in-the-box, he re-emerged to spread
further contagion within the body politic.

Henry died in 1422, followed by Charles 
three months later. In the aftermath,
Henry’s infant son was allowed to lay
claim to the English and French thrones.

It is the crisis in French politics from
roughly 1403 to 1422 that occupies this
fourth volume of Jonathan Sumption’s 
masterpiece: 20 years of political
narrative at roughly 40 pages per annum.  

Some may consider this monumental
self-indulgence. Others, myself included,
will marvel not only at the skill with
which Sumption tells the story but at
its sheer daring. Perhaps not since Lord
Macaulay’s History of England (1848)d
has such mastery been deployed on
so epic a scale. Just as Macaulay wrote 
while occupying a prominent role in
public life, so Sumption is a leading
member of the UK Supreme Court.

the ‘flappers’, the high jinks of Dadaism,
the extraordinary havoc wreaked by the
dust storms in America’s corn belt 
during the mid-1930s, and the mass
deaths caused by the man-made Ukrai-
nian famine. Throughout the period
there was anti-Semitism, discrimination,
and slaughter. Long before Blom gets to 
the Spanish Civil War, a sense of
impending doom pervades the text. 

The effect of these years continues
to be felt and Blom repeatedly tells us
why it is important to know this history.
His vivid, energetic style is enthralling,
but his message is disheartening.

A 600% increase in snares laid since 2011 has put
FFI’s anti poaching team on red alert. Habitat loss
has already pushed the Sumatran tiger to the brink
of extinction but now poachers have stepped up their
efforts to snare these magnificent cats.

Fauna & Flora International (FFI) has put out an
urgent call to the global community to save the last
Sumatran tigers currently existing in the wild – and
specifically to employ more rangers. There are now only
around 500 Sumatran tigers left.

FFI is urgently seeking funds to step up their crucial
conservation programme in Kerinci Seblat National Park,
Sumatra, Indonesia. In order to safeguard the future
existence of these magnificent creatures, it is vital that
more rangers are employed

Right now, the Sumatran tiger faces a number of very
serious threats, which are putting their very survival in 
jeopardy. And, sadly, they are all man-
made threats.

Poaching is a constant danger for the elusive Sumatran
tiger – and now poachers have substantially stepped up
their efforts. Hunters make good money from the tiger’s
beautiful skin and demand is constantly growing. Also,
its bones are illegally exported to use as ingredients in
traditional Asian medicines.

What is really worrying now is that poachers have
increased the number of tiger snares laid by 600% since
2011 and this year snares found have been at almost
record levels.

This is against a backdrop of a very serious loss of
habitat. In the last ten to 15 years, natural forest cover in
Sumatra has been slashed by almost a staggering 40%.
Now there is a newly emerging threat, discovered by tiger
patrols - the growth of illegal coffee plantations in Kerinci
Seblat National Park.

These majestic forest dwellers have been designated
as Critically Endangered on the IUCN Red List, making
the Sumatran tiger one of the most endangered tiger
subspecies on the planet. This is a rating reserved for
animals that face an extremely high risk of extinction
in the wild.

Latest surveys have indicated that there may now be
as few as 500 existing in the wild. Kerinci Seblat National
Park is one of the last places on Earth where they can still
be found.

Today, 170 tigers live in and around Kerinci Seblat
National Park – the largest known population of tigers
anywhere in Sumatra. Since 2007 the number of tigers in
the park has stabilised and begun to slowly grow – largely
thanks to the vital work of FFI’s Tiger Protection and
Conservation Programme. However, now the upsurge in
poaching puts these gains under threat.

Debbie Martyr, FFI Team Leader of the Kerinci Tiger
Project in Sumatra, says:

“So far this year our ranger teams walked almost 1100
miles on forest patrols in and bordering the national park
and destroyed more than 60 active tiger snares - an increase
of 600% since 2011. That is why we need to step up patrol
regimes”. 

Tiger populations are dreadfully fragile.
If FFI cannot recruit more rangers to protect the tigers

against the increased efforts of the poachers all our good
work could be undone.

For all of these reasons, it’s now absolutely vital that we
increase our patrols to protect tigers from poachers – and
work towards greater protection for their delicate habitat.

If we’re going to save the Critically Endangered
Sumatran tiger from complete extinction, it’s vital that we
have the means to take action now.

FFI must raise £83,131. To do that, the charity is
calling on readers to make an urgent contribution 
today. 

Please send a gift, by no later than 9 November, to help
safeguard the future survival of the last few remaining 
wild Sumatran tigers.

Together, we can save the Sumatran tiger from
extinction – but only if we take action immediately.

To take action for the Sumatran tiger please go to www.
FFIsumatrantiger.org or cut the coupon.

England, Arise: 

The People, the King and

the Great Revolt of 1381 

by Juliet Barker
Abacus, 528 pages, £10.99

In the summer
of 1381, after
years of unrest
caused by rising
taxes and a
diminishing
population,
the flames of

rebellion suddenly sprang into
life. Within a few short weeks,
they had consumed almost the
whole of England and looked
set to raze the monarchy itself
to the ground. People from 
every corner of the kingdom
took up arms against what they
saw as unjust suppression by
the church and state, as well as
by its boy king, Richard II. The
reforms they called for were so
radical that, if they had been
realised, every aspect of English
government and society would
have been utterly transformed.

Respected historian Juliet
Barker tells the story of this
remarkable moment in our
history through the lens of
the men and women who took
part. In so doing, she proves
that they were a more diverse
body of rebels than simply
‘peasants’: they included
constables, stewards and even
gentry among their ranks.

downright disturbing trivia,
gathered from the civilisations
of Egypt, Greece and Rome.
Each chapter covers a different
aspect of the past, from art and
literature to magic, entertain-
ment and language.

This is a wonderfully
diverting tome and Hood
writes in a lively and entertain-
ing way, guiding the reader
through some of the more
bizarre and lurid aspects of
the past. So, if you ever wanted
to know what Alexander the
Great really did in India, which
Roman emperor was the most
debauched, how the Greeks
practised contraception, how
Lord Elgin lost both his marbles
and his nose, or the damaging
effect that a sex strike can have
on society (both ancient and
modern), then this is the book 
for you.

to a minor
baronial family.
Yet, by the time
of his death in
1219, he had

climbed to the position of the
highest official in England and
was deemed worthy to be the
subject of the first biography
of a non-royal subject. His
contemporary biographer,
writing in Old French, praised
William as “the best knight
in the world”; his posthumous

reputation has been living off 
this tribute ever since.

Thomas Asbridge charts
William’s spectacular rise to
supremacy in vivid detail. His
subject offers no shortage of 
exciting stories: surviving an
imminent execution at the age
of five at the hands of King 
Stephen (from whom William
learned much about chivalry);
making his fame and fortune
on the knightly tournament
circuit; allegedly sparing
Richard the Lionheart’s life
after besting him in combat;
and driving the French invaders
out of England in 1217 when
aged 70. William’s life is one
that deserves telling once again.

Marshal has a reputation
for being the ultimate loyal
servant, never abandoning
the losing side. But that did
not mean that he refused to
dirty his hands in the squalid
business of politics: he hedged
his bets with the French in 1204
after the loss of Normandy,
and did so again in 1216 when
the French invaded. Asbridge
is too careful a historian to
let this pass without comment,
detecting hubris in his subject.

But was Marshal, as the
subtitle of Asbridge’s book 
claims, really “the power
behind five English thrones”?
He was increasingly a promi-
nent power, but only the single
most important force when
he acted as regent for the
boy-king Henry III after John’s
death in October 1216. 

That his was a “remarkable
life” is beyond contention,
however, and Asbridge does
it full justice in this colourful
and exciting biography that
shows popular but assured
history at its best.

Moreover, far from being
united in a common cause, they
expressed many different kinds
of grievance; indeed, it was not
one revolt, but a series of local
riots captured under the
umbrella of the Peasants’
Revolt. And although Wat Tyler
has gone down in history as its
charismatic leader, Barker
claims that he played only a 
very minor role.

The myth-challenging
occasionally becomes a little
laboured, and the structure is
also rather disjointed because
the story of each local uprising
is told separately. But this does
not detract from a thoroughly
researched, engagingly written
account of a moment when the
world was – almost – turned
upside down.

A Petrol Scented Spring

by Ajay Close 
Sandstone Press, £8.99, 350 pages

The summer of 1914:
women’s suffrage is
one of the great issues
of the day. Arabella
Scott is one of the
militant campaigners
whose demands for
votes for women have
brought them into

conflict with the authorities. Arrested
for arson, she goes on hunger strike.
After being released and re-arrested
several times under the provisions
of the infamous ‘Cat and Mouse’ Act,
she is transferred to prison in Perth.

There she encounters Hugh Ferguson
Watson, an ambitious doctor from
a poor background, who is one of the
few medical men in Scotland prepared
to force-feed the suffragette prisoners.
An epic battle of wills ensues between
Watson and Arabella. He attempts, via
bludgeoning logic and the pain and
humiliation of force-feeding, to break
her spirit. She resists him both physi-
cally and intellectually. During their
confrontations, described by Ajay Close 

with graphic immediacy, a strangely 
intense relationship develops.

Two years pass. The First World War
has reached bloody stalemate, and the
campaign for women’s rights has been
temporarily suspended. Watson weds
a free-spirited woman named Donella,
but their marriage rapidly becomes
a prison for both of them. Repressed
and callously controlling, the doctor
forces his wife from lively sociability 
into isolation and loneliness. Because
of dark suspicions he comes to entertain
about madness in her family, he refuses 
to have sex with her. And, hanging
always over them, is the question of
his strong, oddly twisted feelings about 
Arabella that have never been resolved.
Only by learning more of her husband’s 
past and by asserting her own ambi-
tions can Donella escape the wretched
confines of her life.

This is a memorable work of fiction.
Ingeniously and deviously constructed,
it is a powerful story of two women
forced to draw on their inner resources
to free themselves from the manipula-
tions of a deeply damaged man.

We British: An Epic in Poetry

RADIO Radio 4,
scheduled for Thursday 8 October

What does it mean to be British? One
way to answer this question is to look at
the nation’s history through specific
events – great victories, cataclysmic
defeats and moments where the political
weather abruptly changed. Yet there’s
another way, and that’s to focus instead
on people’s day-to-day lives. It’s this latter
approach that informs We British, a day
of poetry programming weaved through
the Radio 4 schedule on, appropriately
enough, National Poetry Day.

“We’re interested in the intimate, the
more domestic… more bedrooms than
battles,” James Cook, Radio 4’s poetry
and arts editor, tells BBC History
Magazine. “We want [to show] the
emotional lives people were entrenched
in, the way in which the majority of
people lived.”

Presented by Andrew Marr, the day
will feature around six hours of readings,
archive material, interviews and
conversations. Marr’s guests will include
actors such as Dominic West, Charles
Dance and Fiona Shaw, and poets,

Secret history
History’s Ultimate Spies

TV Yesterday, scheduled
for Friday 16 October

Here’s a film that focuses on those who
developed spy networks in the days
before mass communication. It explores
how the methods employed by these
pioneers in subterfuge and skullduggery
are still in use around the world today.

Expect tales of Elizabethan England,
the era when Francis Walsingham’s
clandestine operations entrapped Mary,
Queen of Scots; France, when Cardinal
Richelieu was in his pomp; and the
American Civil War, when Allan
Pinkerton was head of the Union
Intelligence Service.

Letters from the past
How to Survive the Roman

Empire by Pliny and Me

RADIO BBC Radio 4,
scheduled for Monday 26 October

Magistrate Pliny the Younger was a
prolific letter writer. Much of his
correspondence has survived, offering
first-hand insights into life in ancient
Rome. Written by Hattie Naylor and
from the same team that made The Diary
of Samuel Pepys, this new series, based on
these letters, charts Pliny’s time as a
young lawyer.

In the first of five weekday episodes,
Pliny buys a slave, a captive from the
Roman enclave of Caerwent in Wales,
and we begin to see Rome from the
perspective of both master and servant.

including Michael Rosen and Daljit
Nagra. Over the day, we’ll hear Shake-
speare, Christina Rossetti and Ted
Hughes, as well as less famous names,
and pieces where the authorship has long
been forgotten.

According to Cook, Marr has been
a key part of a “glorious extended conver-
sation” to decide which pieces of verse to
include. “There are certain poets that he’s
very keen to talk about, that he feels are
neglected, and there are certain very
famous poets he feels are maybe a bit
overrated,” says Cook. “He’s not a big fan
of Wordsworth, we can probably say.”

The programming will begin with
some of the earliest surviving verse and
“roll through the day in [a] chronological
fashion” so that listeners get a sense of the
sweep of British history, as well as a sense
of our forebears’ lives in specific eras –
grandness and intimacy together.

The idea of competing identities will
also be important. “I don’t want it to feel
too polished,” says Cook. “I want it to feel
like cases are being made and, actually,
that Britishness is a bit rough around the
edges, and that it’s not even easy to settle
on what pieces should or shouldn’t be in
a day like this – because it’s not.”

Love is…
A Very British Romance

with Lucy Worsley
TV BBC Four,
scheduled for Thursday 8 October

We think of romance as a ‘natural’ part
of life. Too simplistic, argues Lucy
Worsley. Many of our innermost
thoughts and feelings are shaped by
social, political and cultural factors that,
unless we stop to think about them, we
hardly even notice. This even applies to
the notion of falling in love.

Worsley’s latest series takes us back to
the Georgian era, a time when rules
around courtship began to be rewritten.
Prior to this time, marriage had

traditionally been as much about
money as finding a soulmate. But the
18th century was when the idea of
‘sensibility’, and particularly the idea
people might acutely respond to the
emotions of another person, began to
become fashionable.

The rise of the novel was key here,
because romantic fiction, in Worsley’s
estimation, was “as revolutionary as a
political manifesto” for the way it
changed how people thought about love
and marriage. Books by the likes of 
Samuel Richardson, Fanny Burney and
Jane Austen didn’t just offer escapism,
they offered new ways of thinking.
Accordingly, for Worsley, the most
influential Georgian wasn’t Wellington
or Nelson, but “Aunt Jane, spinster”.

Face values
Simon Schama’s The Face  

of Britain

DVD (BBC/Spirit Entertainment, 
£19.99, released 19 October)

To look at British portraiture, says
Simon Schama in a preamble to his
latest series, is akin to “combing
through the family album of our
nation”. But “be warned”, he cautions,
we can’t take the faces we see at
“face value”. Instead, our
ideas about some of the
most famous images
from our history rest 
on the interplay
between sitter,
artist and the Great
British public, as
we collectively pass
opinions on these 
artworks.

This interplay can be complex. In
Power and Portraiture – the first of
five themed documentaries – Schama
tells the story of Graham Sutherland’s
1954 portrait of Churchill. Recovering 
from a stroke, Churchill wanted a
“proclamation of his undimmed
vigour”. Sutherland gave him “a
picture of the rugged truth… an
obituary in paint”. Churchill, who
acidly called the picture “a remarkable
example of modern art”, hated the
painting and it was destroyed.

It’s just one of the stories
told with élan in a series

that, in combining his
art historian’s eye for

detail, sharp turn
of phrase and gift
for big narratives,
represents some
of Schama’s best
television work since

the History of Britain.

T
he village of Haworth,
perched on the edge of the
South Pennine moors, would
be a quaint but unremarkable
Yorkshire village but for its
unique connection to one of

British history’s most famous literary
families. But its sleepy tea rooms and
antiquarian bookshops are a far cry from the
crowded industrial town it was in 1820,
when red-haired, Irish-born Patrick Brontë
moved his young family into Haworth
parsonage after taking up the post of curate.

It’s clear on arrival at Haworth that the
bleak, windswept moors were reflected in
the settings for many of the sisters’ books,
particularly Emily’s Gothic masterpiece,
Wuthering Heights. The exposed and isolated
moorland setting of Top Withens, an
abandoned farmhouse about three miles
from Haworth, is thought to have been
Emily’s inspiration for the location of the
Earnshaws’ farmhouse in the novel. The
ruins can be accessed via a path that takes
walkers past a small waterfall known to have
been popular with the sisters. “A perfect
torrent racing over the rocks, white and
beautiful!” wrote Charlotte in November
1854. A chair-shaped rock nearby is said to
have been where the Brontë siblings would
sit and tell each other stories.

The parsonage itself – now a
museum and library under the
care of the Brontë Society – is
the highlight of a trip to
Yorkshire for any literary
pilgrim. Situated on the edge
of the village, adjacent to the
graveyard, the Georgian house
– with adjoining meadow where
the sisters would dry their

washing – is virtually as it looked when the 
family moved in, nearly 200 years ago.
Visitors can walk through the house and
peer into the rooms where the siblings ate,
slept and wrote. The dining room makes for
especially affecting viewing – here, we are
told, the three women would gather every
evening to discuss their writing, walking
round and round the large dining table.
Jane Eyre, Wuthering Heights ands Agnes Grey
were all written in this room.

Death at the parsonage
“When the Brontës moved to Haworth, the
physical isolation of the property mirrored
the social isolation of the family from the
village,” says Claire Harman, author of a
recent biography of Charlotte Brontë.
“Maria Brontë, Patrick’s wife, died the
following year, making it even harder for
the family to integrate with the village,
and leaving six small children ranging from
seven years to just 20 months old. It was 
a terrible bereavement.”

Elizabeth Branwell, Maria’s unmarried
sister, moved to the parsonage to care for the
motherless family. But in 1825 the Brontës
were to suffer more anguish when the two
eldest siblings, 11-year-old Maria and
10-year-old Elizabeth, died of tuberculosis

within six weeks of each other.
“Losing their mother and two

beloved siblings had a profound
effect on the remaining Brontës,”
says Harman. “Overnight
Charlotte, previously the
middle child, had become
the eldest. But where young
Maria had naturally assumed

the role of ‘little mother’,
Charlotte possessed no natural

maternal leadership qualities.”
Instead, the children retreated into an

imaginary world of their own creation –
Angria – where vast lands were conquered
and fascinating characters created. Encour-
aged by Charlotte and the family’s only son,
Branwell, the children wrote and hand-
stitched miniature books and magazines
– some no more than 2 inches high (see
picture below) – for Branwell’s toy soldiers.
These games began a journey into writing
that would last the sisters their entire lives.

Some of these tiny books – and other
objects from the museum collection –
can be seen during a private tour of the
parsonage library.

Out in the world
Says Harman: “Much of the inspiration for
the children’s early writing must surely have
come from their father, himself a published
author of great enthusiasm and ambition.
Unlike most fathers of the day, Patrick
actively encouraged his daughters to read –
even allowing them the works of Byron, who
was widely considered a scandalous writer
– and all the sisters attended school at
various points in their childhoods.

“What was clear from an early age,
however, was that the three remaining
sisters would eventually have
to earn livings as teachers or
governesses – a respectable
occupation for middle-class
women.”

Although Charlotte, Emily
and Anne used their sporadic
periods at school to learn all
they would need for a life of 

teaching, all three loathed being away
from home, and longed to be together at
the parsonage, safe within the family unit
once more.

“The sisters were pretty fatalistic about the
fact they would have to earn a living,” says
Harman, “but they hated being away from
each other and none of them liked children
at all! They clung to the idea that perhaps 
one day they could leave teaching and
support themselves through their writing.

“Eventually they came up with a system
that meant that when one sibling was out
working, the others could have a period of
time at home. But they were all three terribly
homesick. Emily in particular found being
separated from the family unit incredibly
stressful, and developed a profound neurosis
about leaving home. Charlotte, too, became
hyper-sensitive away from home, and
retreated into her Angrian fantasies to ease 
the pain of separation.”

Charlotte did, in fact, spend a year abroad,
teaching at the Pensionnat Heger in Brussels,
where she and Emily had previously studied.
It was a testing period for the 27-year-old,
who developed a passionate, but unrequited,
love for Constantin Heger, who ran the
boarding school with his wife. A collection
of Charlotte’s anguished letters to Heger
– mostly unanswered as he and his wife
sought to detach themselves from what was
becoming an uncomfortable relationship –
are now held in the British Library. Charlotte
would use her experiences in Brussels in her
fourth novel, Villette, published in 1853.

Throughout their periods of time in
Haworth – or away from home – all three
sisters continued to write prolifically. And in
1846, using some of the money left to them

by Aunt Branwell who had
died in 1842, they took the
bold step to publish a
collection of their poems,
under the pseudonyms
Currer, Ellis and 
Acton Bell.

“It was Charlotte who
was the driving force
behind the publication,”

“ALL THREE LOATHED BEING AWAY FROM  

HOME AND LONGED TO BE TOGETHER AT THE 

PARSONAGE, SAFE WITHIN THE FAMILY UNIT ”

says Harman. “Emily was a genius but she
had little desire to please a publisher, or
anyone else for that matter. Anne, too, was
happy to be published but didn’t have the
worldly impetus Charlotte had to get her 
works into print.”

Despite some favourable reviews, the book
sold just two copies – a blow to Charlotte in
particular, who had declared that she wished
to be “forever known”. Undeterred, the
sisters continued writing and their persis-
tence paid off: in 1847, Charlotte’s novel Jane
Eyre was published, becoming an overnighte
success, while Emily’s only novel, Wuthering
Heights, and Anne’s Agnes Grey were bothy
published in December the same year.

Published under the same pseudonyms as
their poems, the three novels received mixed
reviews, but rumours abounded as to who
the mysterious Bells could be. AL

1848, at the age of 31.

More heartache was to come. Still reeling 
from the death of their brother, it soon
became apparent that Emily was also
seriously ill with tuberculosis. Just three
months after Branwell’s death, she perished,
refusing treatment until the day of her death

The loss of Branwell and Emily was

before long Anne, too, was showing signs of
tuberculosis. Despite seeking all available
treatment, Anne died in Scarborough in
May 1849 where she had hoped the warmer 
climate would relieve her symptoms.

“Charlotte was left utterly bereaved by her
siblings’ deaths,” says Harman. “Lost and
alone, she continued pacing around the
dining table at night, as the sisters had once
done together, but was bereft without them.”

Charlotte eventually married curate
Arthur Bell Nicholls, who had come to
Haworth in 1845. But for a woman who had
written such vivid romances in her novels,
the union was far from being a love match to
rival that of Jane Eyre and Mr Rochester, or
Lucy Snowe and Paul Emanuel (Villette).

“Charlotte’s decision to marry intrigues
me,” says Harman. “To marry a man she just
about liked enough but whom she had no
strong emotions for is not an act one might 
have expected from a writer of great
romance. The couple lived at the parsonage
with Patrick, but after just nine months of
marriage Charlotte died from pregnancy-
related complications.”

Patrick, who outlived his entire family,
soon commissioned novelist Elizabeth
Gaskell to write Charlotte’s biography.
Published in 1857, it heralded the start of a
Brontë cult that continues to this day. For
many it is the tragic death of such raw,
flourishing talent that contributes to the
sisters’ ongoing appeal. For others, it is the
descriptive beauty and romance of their
novels. Either way, it is hard to deny that the 
Brontës themselves have a life story as 
moving as any novel.

book is Charlotte Brontë:

A Life (Viking, 2015).

Words: Charlotte Hodgman 

“The energetic storyline of Jane Eyre, not
to mention its brooding hero Mr Rochester,
made the novel an instant hit,” says Harman. 
“The violent and destructive nature of
Wuthering Heights, however, was far more
perplexing for readers, and the book was
widely condemned as being impious and 
dangerously uncouth.”

One damning review declared that: “The
reader is shocked, disgusted, almost sickened
by details of cruelty, inhumanity, and the most 
diabolical hate and vengeance…” 

Tragedy strikes
Any pleasure that the Brontës might have
derived from their newfound literary success
was short-lived. Branwell, who had been

Bending, stooping, sweeping and clearing up leaves by hand
will fast become a thing of the past with the Eckman leaf
blower, vacuum and shredder. Packing a massive 3000W of
power, it leaves other low-priced leaf vacuums trailing behind
with its performance, plus it is quieter and lighter too
(weighs just 3.5kg).

This brilliant machine will easily blow leaves from under
cars, bushes or off gravel driveways into a neat pile and then,
with a flick of a switch, will suck the leaves all up. Before the
leaves are sucked into the huge 45L collection bag, they
go through a 14,000rpm shredding blade (with stone
filter) to reduce them by 90% of their
original volume which is great for compost
heaps. Soft control trigger, front wheels, a
new and exclusive direct-input leaf collection
system, super-fast bag removal, and a strong

FIVE THINGS TO DO IN NOVEMBER

EXHIBITION / FREE ENTRY

Alice in Wonderland

The British Library, London
20 November–17 April 2016 
� 01937 546546
� bl.uk

T
his month sees the launch of an exhibition to celebrate 
the 150th anniversary of the publication of Charles

Lutwidge Dodgson’s much-loved children’s book, Alice’s
Adventures in Wonderland – following the escapades of the
titular girl after she follows a talking, clothed white rabbit
down a hole in a riverbank.

Originally written for the daughter of a family friend –
Alice Liddell – Dodgson’s book (authored under the
pseudonym Lewis Carroll) was a publishing sensation,
popular with both children and adults, including  
Queen Victoria.

The exhibition, which explores how the story of Alice has
captured the imaginations of artists, readers and writers
over the years, also features Dodgson’s original manuscript,
complete with hand-drawn pen-and-ink illustrations. Later
editions of the book featuring illustrations by Mervyn
Peake, Ralph Steadman, Leonard Weisgard, Arthur
Rackham, Salvador Dali and others will also be displayed in
the exhibition.

A number of commemorative events will run alongside 
the exhibition, including a panel discussion about the
book, chaired by broadcaster Lauren Laverne and featuring
author and screenwriter Frank Cottrell Boyce, Children’s
Laureate Chris Riddell and debut novelist Vanessa Tait –
great-granddaughter of Alice Liddell.

MY FAVOURITE PLACE

Out & about

Bali, Indonesia

baffled by the apparent absence
of religious formality. Yet hardly
anywhere is without a temple or 
shrine, since few places lack
divine significance. Indeed, this
island barely 20 times larger
than the Isle of Wight is dotted
with more than 20,000 temples.

Some originated before the
arrival of Hinduism. The
11th-century Pura Tegeh
Koripan is the highest temple in
Bali, near the summit of the
extinct volcano Gunung
Penulisan. Actually a hilltop
complex of five temples now
dedicated to Shiva , its original
foundation certainly precedes
the triumph of the Hindu faith,
its altars displaying carved
figures and even unhewn rock

Bali’s culture has been
influenced by its larger neighbour
to the west, Java, for over 10
centuries, since King Udayana
married a Javan princess in the 
late 10th century. Her son
Erlangga became king of eastern
Java, and Balinese courts adopted
the Javanese language. The
architectural influences show in
the 10th-century ‘elephant cave’

By Arthur Cotterell

For the latest in our historical holidays series,

Arthur explores a rare Hindu enclave in Indonesia,  

a tropical idyll studded with gem-like temples

M
y first visit to
Bali five years
ago was a huge
culture shock.
Though I had 

explored other Indonesian
islands, nothing could prepare
me for such a unique culture.

This beautiful island has
weathered the storm of modern
times rather well, and remains
a cultural gem with an idyllic
landscape. International tourism
has certainly had an impact, but
the Balinese people are infallibly
friendly, and there is always
something new to discover.

The beliefs of maritime
south-east Asia find their focus 
in Bali. The island is known as a
Hindu enclave in largely Muslim
Indonesia, but the Balinese also
piously respect their ancestors
and carefully placate the
indigenous spirits dwelling in the
island. Nothing is considered to
be inanimate, be it a stone, a tree
or a motorcar. During the Hindu
new year festival, reverence for
machines is shown by adorning
the bonnets of vehicles with the
sacred cloth usually wrapped
around the trunks of trees and
prominent rocks.

Small offerings are placed
outside doorways to divert the
attention of malignant spirits.
In paddy fields, similar offerings

lie on the ground next to shrines
dedicated to Dewi Sri, the
indigenous rice goddess, who
long pre-dates the arrival of
Hinduism. Along with the water 
goddess Dewi Danu, she
guarantees prosperity and
receives the gratitude of farmers.

In gardens, special altars are
used for the worship of ancestors, 
believed to descend from
Gunung Agung, Bali’s highest
volcano. From its summit gods
and goddesses also come down to
unroofed temples where, during
festivals, they are fed and
entertained by music and
dance-drama. A Balinese temple 
has no forbidding rooms,
blackened with incense and
occupied by awe-inspiring
images: in fact, they tend to avoid
representations altogether.

Visitors to Bali are often

Goa Gajah, and the rock-hewn
royal monuments at Gunung
Kawi dating from 1080, both
near Ubud in south-central Bali.

Three centuries later, in 1343,
Java’s dominance was cemented
when Gajah Mada of the Javanese
Majapahit dynasty conquered
Bali. The island’s capital moved
to Gelgel and later to Klungkung
in modern Semarapura, where
the remains of the Kerta Gosa
palace complex – built in the
early 18th century and largely
destroyed by the Dutch in 1908
– provide absorbing wandering.

Hindus fleeing the rise of Islam 

The 16th-century Pura 
Tanah Lot. “Watching 
the waves crash onto 
the rocks at the foot of 
this clifftop temple at 
sunset is a memorable 
way to end a day,” 
says Arthur Cotterell

clifftop temple at sunset is a 
memorable way to end a day.

Jawaharlal Nehru, who visited
the island in the 1950s, called Bali
“the morning of the world”. To 
me, it is the last paradise.

ADVICE FOR 
TRAVELLERS

BEST TIME TO GO
Bali’s dry season falls
between April and Septem-
ber, when temperatures
average around 27°C. Major
Hindu rituals and festivals
take place throughout the
year, with additional street
processions and offerings 
a regular occurrence.

GETTING THERE
Bali’s only airport is Ngurah
Rai International Airport
(also known as Denpasar)
but there is currently no
direct flight to Bali from
Europe. UK travellers can
reach Bali via Singapore,
Kuala Lumpur, Hong Kong
or Bangkok. 

WHAT TO PACK
The sun can be fierce,
so it’s sensible to carry
a wide-brimmed hat or
a parasol. Sunscreen is
also a must, and insect
repellent is useful.

WHAT TO BRING BACK
Beautiful wooden carvings
and ikat, a woven silk or
cotton cloth of dyed threads

READERS’ VIEWS

mend the sacred monkey

in the Indonesian archipelago in
the 15th century flooded into
Bali, and several of its most iconic
temples date from the 15th and
16th centuries. Like Pura Tegeh
Koripan, Pura Besakih, on the
slopes of Gunung Agung,
probably dates from prehistoric
times, but has served as a Hindu
temple since the Javan invasion 

of 1284; by the 15th century it
was established as a major place
of worship and is now the holiest
Hindu temple on the island.

Pura Tanah Lot, a 16th-centu-
ry temple perched on a rocky
outcrop off the south-west coast,
is arguably Bali’s most famous
temple – as much for its visual 
appeal as its history. It was
reputedly founded by Javanese
saint Danghyang Nirartha, who
is said to have achieved complete
enlightenment at Pura Uluwatu
in the southernmost peninsula.

Q&AMISCELLANY

Q Which monarch ruled for the 
shortest amount of time – and why?
Andrew Lewis, by email

A
In England, Lady Jane Grey ruled
for only nine days, though many

question whether she was ever really
queen. You might also count Edgar
the Ætheling, the last of the house of
Wessex. He was elected king following
Harold’s death in 1066 but was deserted
by his supporters as William moved on 
London. He was never crowned, and 
reigned for under two months.

The Danish king Swein Forkbeard
invaded and was declared king of
England on Christmas Day 1013 but
died five weeks later. Then there’s Edward
V, who reigned for 86 days – but was
moved, with his brother, to the Tower of
London by his uncle, the lord protector,
who took the throne as Richard III;
Edward was never seen again. In the
11th century three monarchs – Lulach,
Duncan II and Donald III – each lasted
less than a year on the Scottish throne,
though Donald did get a second crack. 

But British and Irish rulers don’t come
close to challenging the record books.
World history, both ancient and modern,
is littered with short-lived monarchs –
some better documented than others.

How about, for instance, ‘Louis XIX’ 
of France? His father, Charles X,
abdicated following an uprising on
2 August 1830. Louis’ wife begged him
not to sign his own abdication, and he
hesitated for 20 minutes – during which
time he was technically king of France.

Another who made the record books
was Sayyid Khalid bin Barghash Al-
Busaid, who became sultan of Zanzibar
in 1896 – for a mere two days. The
British didn’t recognise his right to rule
the strategically important island, and
deposed him by force. His palace was
shelled by the Royal Navy in the shortest
war in history – lasting just 38 minutes.

Miscellany

A
In November 1979
Margaret Thatcher

confirmed publicly that in
1964 Sir Anthony Blunt had,
in return for immunity from
prosecution, confessed to
spying for the USSR from the
late 1930s to 1956.

Thatcher’s statement did
not satisfactorily explain why,
in the 15 years between his
confession and public exposure,
Blunt retained his knighthood
and his positions as director of
the Courtauld Institute of Art
(till 1974) and Surveyor of the
Queen’s Pictures (till 1972).

Media consensus at the
time was that he must have
had support from “a coven of
angels in very lofty places” (to
paraphrase George Steiner’s
celebrated piece in the New
Yorker), implying that Blunt’sr
connections with Cambridge
University and the House of
Windsor had sheltered him

from the security services.
In fact, the opposite seems

to have been the case. It was
Blunt’s old friends from
Cambridge who had leaked
crucial information to the press.
The Queen’s private secretary
was twice instructed (in 1964
and 1972) by the cabinet, acting
on the advice of the security
services, not to dismiss Blunt,
because his sudden departure
might confirm suspicion
that Blunt was indeed the
‘Fourth Man’ of the so-called
Cambridge Five spies. MI5
and MI6 had little interest in
protecting Blunt; they were
motivated more by a desire to
avoid the sort of spy scandals
that had in the past revealed
their failure to outwit the KGB.

GOT A QUESTION?

Every issue, picture editor

Samantha Nott brings you a

recipe from the past. This month

it’s a fruit-flavoured drink made with

the bounty of wild blackthorns

Anthony Blunt, 
pictured here in 
1979, maintained 
several high-profile 
positions despite 
confessing to 
spying for the USSR

Sloe gin
With the enclosure of the
countryside in the 16th and
17th centuries came a huge
increase in blackthorn
bushes, used to divide up
fields, and therefore lots of
sloes. The popularity of gin
at the time meant that there
was an ideal way of making
otherwise quite unpalatable
sloes a bit more exciting.

Sloe gin is a great drink to
prepare in time for Christmas
and the long winter months
that follow. I love the whole
process, from picking the
sloes to hiding the bottles in
a dark corner to mature.

I’ve never made sloe gin
the same way twice – it’s
always a bit haphazard –
but for me the two most
important things are not to
use too much sugar, and to
wait three months before you
drink it (always hard!).

Quantities depend on how
many sloes you pick, and are
very rough – but, broadly
speaking, use enough sloes
to half-fill your bottle, and
about 50g of sugar per litre.

INGREDIENTS
• 500g ripe sloes
• 50g sugar
• 1 litre gin

METHOD
Wash the sloes and pick off
any stems, then pat them dry 
with a tea towel or paper
towel. Prick the sloes, or
freeze them overnight so that
their skins split. Add the
sloes to a sterilised bottle or
jar till it’s just under half full.

Top up the bottle or jar
with gin and add the sugar.
Seal the jar or bottle and
leave for three months or
longer, shaking the jar
periodically to ensure that
the sugar dissolves.

Before drinking, strain the
gin from the sloes through a
sieve or muslin and re-bottle.

Note: this recipe uses a bit
less sugar than most. More
sugar can always be added 
to taste before drinking.

VERDICT
Country Christmas in a glass!

Difficulty: 2/10
Time: 20 minutes
preparation, 3 months 
maturation

Sloe gin: 
happiness from 

the hedgerow!

My history hero

H
ypatia was a Greek mathematician, astronomer and
philosopher from the Egyptian city of Alexandria,
then under Roman rule. There she was head of
the Neoplatonist school, at which she lectured on
various subjects, as well as being a staunch defender

of the city’s Great Library. She was brutally murdered by a mob of
Christian zealots, possibly working on the orders of Alexandria’s 
archbishop, Cyril.

When did you first hear about Hypatia?
I was 11 years of age and had just started at Bolton-on-Dearne
secondary modern in South Yorkshire. Because our class wasn’t
making any progress, the headmaster brought in his wife –
a disciplinarian in stockings and spectacles. She said: “I’m going
to tell you about a remarkable woman called Hypatia who gave
her life for education. She studied at the greatest library the
world has ever known – the library of Alexandria. This library
contained all the ancient Greek works, the New Testament, the 
Old Testament, ancient scrolls, ancient history…”

What kind of person was Hypatia?
It was a time when women were regarded as second-class citizens

– in fact, men treated them as property. Yet they couldn’t suppress
Hypatia’s thirst for knowledge. She had an extraordinary range of
accomplishments for someone in any era – and to achieve these as
a woman was unthinkable. She gathered knowledge from all over
the world and imparted it to the people. All this great art, and she 
defended it. 

What made her a hero?
People expect your hero to be someone like George Mallory or Joe
Louis, but Hypatia is, by far, the most sensational hero I’ve ever
read about. She was an astronomer, she was a mathematician, she
was a philosopher. She was a great beauty too. And she rode to the
library on a chariot! Everyone wanted to marry her but she turned
them all down, because she was devoted, utterly, to the library.
The Greeks and the Arabs and the Phoenicians and the Italians
met there. The scientists and the mathematicians and the physi-
cists and the scholars met there and they imparted knowledge. 

What do you think was her finest hour?
Probably her opposition to Cyril, the archbishop of Alexandria.
He despised her because she stood for learning and science,
which the early church had identified as paganism. Their igno-
rance was quite dreadful. She was in great personal danger but
continued to teach. She died on her way to work, set upon by a
fanatical mob of Cyril’s parishioners. They dragged her from her
chariot, tore off her clothes and flayed her flesh from her bones.
She was killed on the spot, torn apart for her defence of art and
all that was right.

They then went into the library, burning things, destroying all
the writings of centuries, of earliest man. Hundreds of works of
art were destroyed, hundreds of manuscripts. Discoveries and
ideas and passions were extinguished. The losses were incalculable,
but the wonderful Hypatia fought with her last breath to save
them. After they’d murdered her, they burned her remains. And 
Cyril was made a bloody saint. 

Can you see any parallels between you and Hypatia?
My biggest love in life is meditation. I love peace, I love science
and I love people of this nature. Katharine Hepburn was the
closest I’ve come to Hypatia. Hepburn was incredibly powerful
and I had marvellous conversations with her about life and
education. Hypatia was a part that Hepburn should have played.
She had that edge, that power, that passion. She had great
knowledge and had studied all the great religions. I challenged
and challenged and challenged Hepburn and I learned and
learned and learned. I’d have been the same with Hypatia.  

If you could meet Hypatia, what would you say to her?
I would say: “Thank you for being a great example. And thank
you for being a great servant to the arts and the sciences.” Her
tapestry was vast. She was a servant to mankind and we owe her
an immense debt of gratitude. I can say – with cosmic gusto – she 
is my hero. We shall never see her like again. 
Brian Blessed was talking to Nige Tassell

mankind and we owe her

24.  Telling a Story with Pictures—The Photo Essay

Learn the Inside Secrets of
Professional Photographers
Photographs can preserve cherished memories, reveal the beauty of life,
and even change the world. Yet most of us point and shoot without really
being aware of what we’re seeing or how we could take our photo from 
good to great.

Just imagine the images you could create if you trained yourself to “see” 
as the professionals do. With Fundamentals of Photography, you’ll
learn everything you need to know about the art of taking unforgettable
pictures straight from photographer and National Geographic Fellow
Joel Sartore—a professional with over 30 years of experience. Whatever 
your skill level, these 24 engaging lectures allow you to hone your
photographer’s eye, take full advantage of your camera’s features, and 
capture magical moments in any situation or setting imaginable.
