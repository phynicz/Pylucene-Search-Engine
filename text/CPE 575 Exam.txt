II. Describe how instructions for the addressing modes listed are generally coded.  ( 5 Marks)
b. Write a program that generates 100 Hz pulses on p3.1 with 60% duty cycle	(9 Marks)

3a.	Four speakers(Spk1, spk2, spk3, spk4) are connected to Port 3 of the 8051 microcontroller and are sequentially buzzed for 1s with 0.01s inter-speaker switching time.
i. Sketch the circuit described
ii. Write an assembly language program to implement the circuit as specified. ( 10  Marks) 
b.	It is required to use timers to implement timing operation for 8051 microcontroller. Intervals desired include: I. 150 counts to overflow	II. 550 counts to overflow. III. 100000 counts.  IV.	8 Counts
