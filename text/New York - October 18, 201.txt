1 “Far from destroying our democracy,” 
writes Frank Rich in last issue’s cover 

story on the importance of Donald Trump, 
“he’s exposing all its phoniness and corrup-
tion in ways as serious as he is not. And 
changing it in the process” (“Donald 
Trump Is Saving Our Democracy,” Sep-
tember 21–October 4). “The best writer on 
the confluence of pop culture & politics, 
Frank Rich was born to write on Trump,” 
tweeted ProPublica’s Jesse Eisinger. Other 
readers agreed that Rich gave needed 
insight into Trump’s impact on presidential 
politics. “Whatever his motivation, what-
ever his intention,” wrote commenter Ron-
nieG, Trump “is playing devil’s advocate 
to both parties and exposing weaknesses, 
contradictions, and outright  cruelty and 
injustice in a whole host of current U.S. 
policies and prejudices. That exposure will 
hopefully prove to be invaluable fodder for 
change in both sides—and not necessarily 
or even remotely in the direction of Trump’s 
supposed positions.” “In one amazing feat,” 
tweeted Jennifer Kates, Rich “distills the 
Trump shitshow and alchemizes it into  
a reason to be hopeful.” Blogger Steve M. 
at No More Mister Nice Blog felt Rich was 
giving Trump too much credit. Rich, he 
wrote, is “paving the way for what I fear is 
the inevitable ‘reassessment’ phase of the 
Trump era, when the smart set will stop 
mocking the man and start writing pieces 
with titles like ‘Taking Donald Trump Seri-
ously.’ ” Esquire’s Charles P. Pierce agreed. 
“How exactly does Trump’s tasteless 
flaunting of his wealth work against the 
politics created by the destruction of our 
tepid campaign-finance laws? … Does 
Rich think that the people are supporting 

Trump because of their disgust with money 
in politics? Or because they realize that all 
politics is a sham of a façade?” Other read-
ers marveled at the cover photo-illustra-
tion, which featured Donald Trump in  
a powdered wig, cravat, and waistcoat.  
“A thing of beauty—or nightmares. I can’t 
decide which,” tweeted Talking Points 
Memo’s Nick Martin. 

2 Alex Morris’s story on the spouses of 
trans women sparked an intense and 

emotional conversation about those who 
choose to leave a transitioning partner 
(“My Husband Is Now My Wife,” Septem-
ber 21–October 4). “It only seems to be 
wives who get judged for leaving,” wrote 
Cuttlefish12. “Men don’t stick around. No 
one judges them because apparently ask-
ing a man to consider a gay relationship is 
inconceivable while asking a woman to 
suddenly become a lesbian is normal … 
Many [trans women] get to have the wife 
at home raising their kids while they pur-
sue their career. I don’t think it’s at all sur-
prising that many of these wives are bitter 
and angry. I just hope that with greater 
awareness and acceptance of trans people, 
more trans women and men can begin liv-
ing authentically much, much earlier as 
many young people are doing today.” 
“When I transitioned, my wife left me,” 
wrote alison.hudson. “I completely under-
stood why. We share custody of our kids, 
who were 2, 5, and 9 when I started tran-
sitioning … If anything, my relationship 
with them is far better than it was when  
I was ‘Dad,’ especially since I was angry 
and bitter and depressed then. I am active 
in their lives; I walk them to school, help

elizabeth miller sat in her living room with her wedding album 
in her lap. It had been a long while since she’d brought it up from the basement, 
and the brown leather cover was worn, the pages slightly yellowed. From under 
their plastic covering, the pictures show pink linen tablecloths and taffeta gowns 
and Elizabeth in a dainty white Laura Ashley dress and a flower 
crown, peering up at the camera with that expectant newly-
wed’s look—heaps of bliss, a dash of terror. Next to her in the 
pictures, wearing a gray morning coat, owlish glasses, and 
a thick beard, is her groom, Dan, who is now her wife, Diana.

them with their homework, take them to 
the movies on weekends, and do my best to 
nurture them and raise them into decent 
adults. My son—the oldest and the one 
who remembers the most from ‘before’—
has told me more than once that he likes 
me more now than he did then, and that 
he’s glad I transitioned so I could be happy. 
I generally agree with you about the hope 
from increasing acceptance and transition 
earlier in life. But for those of us who were 
denied that, don’t assume the transitioning 
of a parent is automatically a bad thing.” 
Many more transgender individuals con-
tributed to the discussion, including com-
menter chrissie.see: “As someone in transi-
tion right now, someone whose marriage 
suffered in precisely this way, and someone 
whose children are, like their mother, con-
fronting the issues raised by my changes,  
I found this article unflinchingly honest, 
even to the point of being uncomfort-
able. Transition does bring changes in 
more than just the bodies of those who 
travel this road, and while that won’t likely 
alter the paths on which we find ourselves, 
we should—and most of us do—remember 
that, and, on some level, regret that it isn’t 
easier on those we love.” 

3 “How Has Chinatown Stayed China-
town?” asked Nick Tabor in his story 

on the neighborhood that has “largely 
resisted the laws of the real-estate market” 
(September 21–October 4). One China-
town native, Ham07, disputed Tabor’s 
reporting that Chinatown hasn’t changed. 
“Gentrification is happening … the build-
ing where my parents live was sold to a big 
real-estate company and half the building’s 
rent-stabilized tenants got moved out by 
threat or payoff. This happened quickly, all 
within six months’ time. This developer 
actually has an internet ad in Chinese, 
seeking buildings in Chinatown, and no, it 
is not a Chinese-owned real-estate com-
pany … Sad to see lower Manhattan will 
eventually lose a cultural icon.” Paul.cantor 
thought the story should have addressed 
the role of organized crime. “There’s a quiet 
organized-crime element in Chinatown 
that really keeps things humming along. It 
should come as no surprise that the minute 
the Italian mob got squeezed out of Little 
Italy, gentrification became a problem. The 
one good thing the ‘old’ New York had was 
that it  regulated itself. Leaving things up 
to city government will lead you nowhere.”

cover (September 21–October 4) was by 
Sharelle Roberts for Raffaele Mollica.

on july 14, a conservative group began releasing a series of 
undercover videos showing officials from Planned Parenthood 
negotiating, in blunt and sometimes callous terms, the sale of fetal 
tissue for medical research. The videos set off a chain of events that 
culminated, strangely enough, in John Boehner’s resignation as 
Speaker of the House of Representatives. And so a journalistic sting 
operation intended to expose the alleged depravity of social liberal-
ism instead wound up exposing the fragile psyche of the American 
right, which remains unable to handle the realities of holding par-
tial power in a divided government without regularly freaking out.

The intermediary steps in that bizarre sequence involved a 
now-familiar procession of political rituals. The videos instantly 
catapulted Planned Parenthood to the top of conservative activ-
ists’ hierarchy of intolerable evil, thus triggering an ingrained 
response to shut down the federal government, as had been 
threatened over Obama’s immigration policies and carried out 
over Obamacare. Most Republicans, including Boehner, regarded

this plan as horrendously misguided. Some recent NBC–
Wall Street Journal poll numbers help explain their reluc-
tance. Americans dislike the Republican Party quite a lot: 
Only 29 percent view it favorably, 45 percent unfavorably. 
They regard President Obama more favorably (46-40) 
and Planned Parenthood more favorably still (47-31). 
Another poll found that only a fifth of the public would 
rather shut down Washington than maintain funding for 
Planned Parenthood. The proposed strategy—an unpopu-
lar party using an unpopular tactic against a popular 
president in order to defund a popular organization—
understandably struck Boehner as ill-advised.

Faced with the Speaker’s reluctance to join in their sui-
cidal gesture du jour, his tormentors resorted to the only 
leverage at their disposal: threatening to depose him. 
(Boehner’s party controls 247 of 435 seats, meaning a defec-
tion of just 29 agitated Republicans could, in theory, take 
the gavel out of his hand.) The ritual of demands, threats, 
and nervous pacification proceeded much as it has many 
times before, until it climaxed with Boehner’s unexpected 
announcement that they could take this job and shove it. 

This was something new. The activists in the House had 
not just flexed their muscles but achieved a win. Far from 
delivering them a cherished victory, however, Boehner’s 
announced resignation threw the rebels into disarray. This 
became clear in the ensuing days, during the succession 
struggle over the party leadership. The activists briefly ral-
lied around Daniel Webster, a Floridian, as a potential 
Speaker, an effort that quickly collapsed. When Kevin 
McCarthy, the incumbent majority leader, solidified his 
position to succeed Boehner, some insurgents mustered a 
brief flurry of enthusiasm for Trey Gowdy of South Carolina 
to fill McCarthy’s job. Gowdy decided instead to stay in the 
comfort of his chairmanship of the Benghazi Committee. 
Tellingly, neither Webster’s or Gowdy’s supporters expressed 
any belief their leadership would fulfill the demand that 
precipitated Boehner’s resignation. (For those who have 
already lost the thread, that would be shutting down the 
government over Planned Parenthood.)

The disappearance of the issue that had triggered the 
entire meltdown provided an important clue to the 
unusual nature of the confrontation. The rift dividing 
Boehner and his antagonists was not ideological or even 
necessarily substantive, and the rebel demands were not 
merely extreme—they were implacable. 

Anti-Boehner Republicans described themselves as “con-
servatives.” (Representative Walter Jones: “I don’t really 
know Kevin [McCarthy] that well, but I know that conser-
vatives are not ready to have him.”) But Boehner is also a 
conservative—barely less so, if at all, than his opponents. He 
came to power in the House as an original lieutenant of 
Newt Gingrich, who helped Republicans discover that their 
party’s only chance of power lay in withholding cooperation 
and instead attacking the Democratic majority. Boehner 
vociferously opposed all of Obama’s major undertakings 
during the president’s first two years in office, and when he 
became Speaker, he advocated for their repeal and advanced 
proposals that would roll policy dramatically in the opposite 
direction. Major legislation ground to a halt, with the two 
parties at odds on health care, taxes, regulation, and the gen-
eral role of government.

That is to say that, contrary to the recriminations of 
Boehner’s Republican critics and the nostalgia-tinged acco-
lades heaped on him by moderates, Boehner did not preside 

over an era of compromise or bipartisanship. The over-
whelming thrust of his tenure was one of obstruction. But 
obstructionism meant stalemate, and stalemate meant 
maintaining the status quo. Having deemed the status quo 
after two years of Obamaism a socialist monstrosity, the reb-
els demanded that the GOP bend the president to its will. 
Lacking the two-thirds majority required in both chambers 
to override a veto, however, it never had a chance to do this. 
None of which prevented bitter recriminations. The ulti-
mate source of right-wing anger at Boehner was the Obama 
administration’s continued existence.

Fury over not having enough power to force your leader 
to wield more power than is constitutionally possible is not 
an emotional state conducive to stable coalition- building. 
Over the years, right-wing discontent has sundered the 
party into a number of ever-shifting sub- factions. The 
“Republican Study Committee” used to serve as headquar-
ters for those most dedicated to annoying their party’s lead-
ers. In 2010, the “Tea Party Caucus” formed, overshadowing 
the RSC before fading away. This past January, believing the 
ranks of the RSC had swollen with too many halfhearted 
members, a core of true believers split off to form the “Free-
dom Caucus.” Perhaps eventually the Freedom Caucus will 
give way to a Blood-Dimmed Tide Is Loosed Coalition. 

Like the Weather Underground of the ’70s, the Free-
dom Caucus keeps the identity of most of its members 
secret. Around 40 representatives are believed to belong, 
though only nine publicly disclose their membership. “It’s 
like Fight Club,” said Jim Bridenstine, one of the nine. 
David Frum, a moderate-conservative commentator, has 
mockingly summed up the beliefs of these fundamental-
ists as “If people don’t appreciate what we are saying, then 
say it louder,” but the Freedom Caucus’s most specific stra-
tegic contribution is literally that. “Many members want 
the leadership to be more vocal across the board,” Ted Poe 
of Texas explained to the Washington Post. “Things we 
bring up need to have more enthusiasm. Back home, they 
wouldn’t mind a little more fire and brimstone.”

In 2011, during a strangely pervasive swell of dissatisfac-
tion among Barack Obama’s erstwhile supporters, I wrote 
that liberals have trouble handling authority. In general, we 
are much more comfortable fantasizing about power; the 
sensation of holding and using it seems to unsettle us, and 
we curl into ourselves with disappointment. Conservatives 
displayed far less grumpiness toward George W. Bush than 
liberals have toward Obama until the very end, when Bush’s 
presidency collapsed so irretrievably the right had to hastily 
abandon its largely worshipful pose and write him out of 
the conservative tradition in order to contain the fallout.

Conservatives in the Freedom Caucus suffer from a simi-
lar but different problem: They do not seem capable of com-
prehending a world in which they exert less than total 
power. This failure to compute leads to bursts of angry 
behavior that is ineffectual by design. No scalp will satisfy, 
not when any new head starts to look like another scalp. No 
Freedom Caucus member who finds himself in the party 
leadership can be anything but a sellout, since betrayal is the 
only explanation for the failure of the right-wing agenda. 

Last week, House Republicans met to plan their post-
Boehner future and came away with nothing more than a 
generalized agreement as to the need to be “more aggressive” 
and “play offense.” Representative Carlos Curbelo told the 
Washington Post, “It was a therapy session.” Therapy, not a 
new Speaker, may be exactly what Republicans need. ■

visitors’ day,” says James 
Earl Jones in a farm-bred 
accent several notches 

folksier than the voices of CNN, Mufasa, 
and Darth Vader. He and Cicely Tyson 
are seated across a card table and sur-
rounded by the accoutrements of old 
age—crutches, wheelchairs, and other 
flotsam. None of it belongs to Jones, 
who is 84, or Tyson, who doesn’t give her 

age but is reportedly 90. These are only 
props, strewn across the back half of  
a large rehearsal room on 42nd Street. 
Flynn Earl Jones, James’s son and assis-
tant, is sitting in a far corner of the room, 
looking over notes.

but by taking parts that articulated the 
cause. “I really could not afford the luxury 
of being an actress,” she says. “I had some 
issues that I really wanted to address, and  
I chose my career as a platform.” In the ’70s, 
her roles in Sounder and Roots made her  
a civil-rights icon. Only over the past decade 
or so has she been willing to take roles that 
are less message-driven, partly because she 
feels that the opportunities have expanded. 
“I don’t have to point out to you what’s 
happened on television as far as blacks are 
concerned, virtually taking over,” she says. 
Shortly after our meeting, Viola Davis will 
become the first black winner of a Best 
Actress in a Drama Emmy for How to Get 
Away With Murder. Tyson was also nomi-
nated, for a guest role on the same show.

After their early collaborations, Tyson 
and Jones did two movies together in the 
’70s. Since then, they’ve watched each 
other work: Jones has always admired 
Tyson’s “ability to take chances,” and she 
tries to catch everything he does: “I know 
the sensitivity of this being.” After two 
decades away, she returned to Broadway 
in 2013, spending two years (including  
a tour) in an African-American revival of 
Horton Foote’s The Trip to Bountiful. For 
years she’d asked her agent to “get me my 
Trip to Bountiful”—meaning a dramatic 
swan song akin to Geraldine Page’s turn 
in the 1985 movie—after which she would 
retire. Yet after taking that very role, Tyson 
kept going. “I wonder why people retire to 
do nothing,” she says. Her only experience 
with retirement homes comes from visiting 
friends and researching parts like this one.

Despite his audible majesty onscreen, 
Jones never left the theater and has lately 
been on a Broadway tear—six shows in ten 
years. One of those was Cat on a Hot Tin 
Roof, the second all-black Broadway revival 
he’s starred in. No matter the strides they 
and their peers have made, both actors 
believe such race-conscious productions 

“ I wonder why 
people retire  
to do nothing.”

remain necessary and valuable. “Ethnicity 
is still an important factor,” Jones says. “You 
look at the police issue in the young pub-
lic, there’s a lot to be resolved. In fact, each 
political climate adds more junk to it than 
air … Everybody sat back and waited for 
Obama to solve everything. Big mistake. 
That’s not what he was there for.” 

“God bless him,” adds Tyson. But, she’s 
quick to note, The Gin Game is an essen-
tially race-blind script: “Anybody can find 
themselves in this situation.” Jones con-
curs: “We all get old.” Coburn made a few 
revisions for this production, but his only 
major change was to make the characters 
older, accommodating both these particu-
lar actors and the fact that Fonsia’s original 
age, 71, is practically in midlife now. 

Tyson signed on to The Gin Game first—
despite a few reservations about “the kind 
of language [Fonsia] is forced to use”—
and “when I read it, I thought, Oh, God, 
this is James Earl Jones. I couldn’t read it 
 without hearing his voice, seeing his physi-
cal action.” She says she hasn’t yet found 
the core of Fonsia, an apparently passive 
woman who’s nonetheless alienated all 
the men in her life. Jones is feeling surer-
footed, thanks in part to a book his son gave 
him. “What is it called, Flynn?” Jones calls 
out. “The DSM-5,” Flynn responds—that 
is, the bible of psychiatric illnesses. “What 
we have is a person with a narcissistic 
 disorder,” Jones continues. “Really, he’s  
a lot like Mr. Trump.” 

Contra their roles, Jones is the pussycat 
in the room, Tyson the boisterous agitator. 
When I make the mistake of addressing 
them both as “you guys”—twice—she 
snaps: “He’s the guy. I’m the lady! What if I 
called you a gal?” Jones, by contrast, muses 
abstractly on any given subject, from gam-
bling—“inviting some spiritual force into 
the world”—to the real subject of The Gin 
Game. “We all maybe don’t get old alone,” 
he says, “but we do get old privately, within 
ourselves. We have to deal with the fact that 
time is closing and closing and closing in on 
you. I won’t say I look forward to dying, but 
I’m not at this moment afraid of it. There 
was a beginning once, and that was pretty 
darn exciting. And now I’ll have another, 
not similar but definitive, experience.”

Tyson may not be going so quietly. 
“Young people think they’re too smart to 
let those things happen to them,” she says, 
meaning “incarceration” in a  nursing home. 
“But there are so many  circumstances that 
allow people to fall into that situation. And 
time is the enemy. Time.” It hasn’t quite 
caught up with her. People keep sending 
Tyson scripts—“Broadway shows! Very 
attractive. But I’ve gotta deal with one 
thing at a time.” ■

to be black-tie (Tyson gets a Kennedy Cen-
ter Honor in December; Jones already has 
one), today they are dressed for work—he 
in a gray blazer and sensible shoes, she in 
denim and a sequined U.S. Open cap. 
They’ve just rehearsed the second scene in 
D. L. Coburn’s 1977 Pulitzer Prize–winning 
play, in which two neglected old-timers 
seek solace over a pack of cards.

“It’s a very disturbing play to me,” says 
Tyson. Over several rounds of gin rummy—
a game the actors are still getting the 
hang of—Tyson’s fragile Fonsia repeatedly 
beats Jones’s Weller, a bombastic former 
businessman and self-styled master of 
the game. The luckier she gets, the nas-
tier he becomes, threatening to destroy  
their nascent friendship and, perhaps, 
their images of themselves. “You think it’s  
a piece about playing cards, but it’s not,” 
says Tyson. “Because what you’re doing is 
delving into the personalities of two very 
sad, lonely people.”

It isn’t a very flattering portrait of old 
age—but then, asks Jones, “is there one?” 
Tyson and Jones seem to handle it uncom-
monly well. The Gin Game brings them 
back together on Broadway for the first 
time in 49 years. They met in Jean Genet’s 
early-’60s spectacle The Blacks, which did 
as much for the avant-garde as for racial 
diversity onstage. “If there’s a black actor  
you were to hear of in the next three decades, 
they were in that play,” says Jones.

Did their characters interact? “He was 
my lover,” Tyson says, pointing emphati-
cally at Jones. Did they have chemistry? “It 
was all chemistry,” says Jones, and Tyson 
belts out a laugh. “It wasn’t so much the 
material as the things that went on while 
we were performing,” she says. “Every single 
night there was an incident of some kind, 
like someone running out in the middle 
of it. Somebody [from the audience] was 
carted away in an ambulance and taken to 
Bellevue. A play should be written about the 
performance and the cast of The Blacks.”

In 1966, Tyson and Jones reunited for a 
short-lived Broadway revue of black spiritu-
als and readings. But the Great White Way 
was literally that, decades away from any 
meaningful African-American presence.  
“I remember, there was a production on 
Broadway called Subways Are for Sleeping,” 
says Jones. “You go see the musical, there 
were no ethnic people on the subway! We 
knew better. The cast of The Blacks rallied—
‘Let’s go picket this fucker!’—but that wasn’t 
my thing. I was hoping I’d find something 
better to do, and I wasn’t good at it. To 
picket you must be able to articulate what 
your cause is, and I can’t always do that.”

Tyson took a more overtly political 
approach—not by carrying a picket sign

One in eight  
adults who think 
they were born 
alone are carrying 
around, like 
a change purse, 
some residue   
of a sibling they  
never knew existed.

ronment in which and against which genes 
give rise to who you are, an internal environ-
ment populated nevertheless by an entire 
orchestra of aliens, some of them fiddling 
away in the brain, and each with its own evo-
lutionary interests at stake. 

What aliens do they mean? They point 
also to viruses and parasitic diseases—both 
the ones that have already colonized our 
DNA (depending on how you count, as 
much as 45 percent of it) and the new ones 
we could catch, like toxoplasma gondii, just 
for instance, which is three times as likely to 
be found in schizophrenics. And then 
there’s what Kramer and Bressan call “for-
eign human cells”—a sort of catchall for 
whenever parts of one person end up in 
another. Which happens a lot! There’s the 
way identical twins invariably share cells 
like Matchbox cars at the early stages of 
development; the way, they theorize, even 
fraternal twins arise from the same bundle 
of cells; the way a mother’s immune system 
can attack and partially colonize a fetus she 
is carrying; the way a baby can send cells 
back in the other direction, including stem 
cells, which can grow into just about any-
thing; and the way in which that mother-
child dynamic may direct the in-house 
genetic engineering called gene imprinting. 
And it also includes, yes, Lydia Fairchild’s 
vanishing twin, and the ones that many of 
us have been apparently hosting, unwit-
tingly, our whole lives. All of which, Kramer 
and Bussan say, may just help explain why 
your son is gay. To take one of their more 
speculative claims. 

As many as one in eight single-baby new-
borns, and possibly more, began life as one 
of two, later absorbing the other baby-to-be 
before anyone really noticed (including the 
baby, who at that point typically wouldn’t 
have produced so much as a single limb). 

Which means that one in eight adults who 
think they were born alone are carrying 
around, like a change purse, some residue of 
a sibling they never knew existed; in some 
cases, that change purse could be, inside a 
woman, say, a male kidney. Foreign cells can 
come from children too; an autopsy study of 
46 mothers showed male cells in 13 of their 
kidneys, ten of their livers, and four of their 
hearts, thanks to stem cells’ having passed 
through the placenta, taken root where 
needed, and sprouted, sometimes into 
whole patches of tissue. In another study, 
this one of 59 women, 63 percent harbored 
male cells in their brains. 

And then there are the more extreme 
cases, like fetus-in-fetu, a kind of twin 
growth almost too grotesquely surreal to 
mention. Almost. Possibly the gnarliest 
example is the case of Sanju Bhagat, an 
Indian man who carried his twin inside him 
for 36 years, until a 1999 surgery designed 
to relieve swelling in his stomach so massive 
it made him look pregnant. “To my surprise 
and horror, I could shake hands with some-
body inside,” a presiding doctor told report-
ers of the procedure. “First, one limb came 
out, then another limb came out. Then some 
part of genitalia, then some part of hair, 
some limbs, jaws, limbs, hair.” As everyone 
noticed, the finger nails were quite long.

This is not, by the way, the speculative 
part of the paper; it’s the real-deal part. In 
fact, what Kramer and Bressan have writ-
ten is technically called a review, which 
means mostly it summarizes and analyzes 
existing research, enclosing in a single phe-
nomenological circle a wide range of what 
had been seen as divergent subjects, group-
ing some pretty routine stuff with genetic 
anomalies that used to land you in a freak 
show. And then asks us to contemplate, 
and their colleagues to study more closely, 
what it all means for behavior and psychol-
ogy and identity that a part of your brain 
really belongs to your daughter or your 
unborn twin—or, for that matter, a virus 
that’s hijacked the control panels of at least 
some patch of cells. There are those who 
will wonder just how rigorous that specula-
tion is, and, perhaps for them, the authors 
have preemptively chosen to open their 
paper with a quotation from Star Trek: The 
Next Generation (the Borg cycle, of course). 
But in fairness they probably could’ve also 
used H. G. Wells, Dostoyevsky, Freud, or 
any of the Romantic poets. “We argue that 
we do not have a unitary ‘self,’ ” Kramer and 
Bressan write. “We argue that an incessant 
struggle among a very large number of 
‘selfs’—some human, some not—deter-
mines who we are.” Is it insane to say, at 
least as a metaphor for mosaic identity, that 
sounds sort of  reasonable?  ■

animals. But, man, isn’t that even creepier?
Don’t relax—it’s not just twins. In a new 

paper, “Humans As Superorganisms,” Peter 
Kramer and Paola Bressan of the University 
of Padua describe a typical human body as 
a teeming mass of what they call “selfish 
entities.” Picture a tree warped by fungus, 
wrapped with vines, dotted at the base with 
mushrooms and flowers, and marked, mid-
way up, by what the tree thought the whole 
time was just a knot but turns out to be a 
parasitic twin. This is the human super-
organism—not the tree, not the tangled 
mess of things doing battle with it, but the 
whole chunk of forest—and Kramer and 
Bressan would like to place it at the very 
center of the way we think about human 
behavior. They are psychologists, and their 
paper is a call to arms to their fellow shrinks, 
exhorting them to take seriously as a pos-
sible cause of an enormous buffet of behav-
ioral phenomena—from quotidian quirks, 
to maddeningly opaque disorders like 
autism, to schizophrenia—the sheer vol-
ume and weird diversity of completely crazy 
alien shit going on in just about all of our 
bodies, just about all the time. 

At least one part of this superorganism 
theory is not all that unfamiliar, especially 
to anyone who remembers recent articles 
by Michael Pollan and others about what is 
often called “the brain in your gut.” That 
part: that our stomachs are, actually, zoos. 
In fact, they’re not really our stomachs. 
Principally, they belong to the hundred tril-
lion bacteria enticed by evolution into your 
chutes-and-ladders intestinal tract, then 
enlisted to eat your food for you. The 
weirder thing is that evolution also put hun-
dreds of millions of neurons there, which 
means there’s a lot of trouble to be caused 
by those 160 or more species of bacteria 
(yes, full species). And the behavioral effects 
are pretty startling. Take a mouse, evacuate 
his intestines, and repopulate them with the 
microbes of another mouse, and he’ll act 
like the other mouse—adventurous mice 
become timid. In humans, what is delicately 
called “gut flora” affects not just obesity but 
also anxiety, and some think it plays a role 
in disorders as far-ranging as MS and Par-
kinson’s. What role exactly? Who knows? 
Though there have been some attempts to 
treat autism with yogurt.

Okay, so, the gut is weird. But what if you 
lived in the gut? What if you were the gut? 
Kramer and Bressan want us to stop looking 
at our stomachs like we’re hosts to some 
messy guests, or homeowners too disgusted 
by a particular closet to ever go poking 
around in it, because, they write, the human 
superorganism isn’t something to observe 
from the privileged perch of the self. Instead, 
they suggest, it envelops the self—the envi-

TIMES 
SQUARE 

in the de Blasio era.

“I gotta go, I gotta go, guys,” says the 
woman good-naturedly, still smiling, as she’s 
pincered between two Minnies. The mute 
characters paw at her in a kind of creepily 
adorable pantomime. Iron Man offers to 
take her picture, as if this were a moment 
she’d want to cherish. She starts to squirm. 
“I gotta go,” she says more forcefully, then 
wriggles free from the scrum. As she hurries 
north, her eyes turn not to the world-famous 
gauntlet of towering digital screens over-
head but to the five-inch screen clutched in 
her hand. This is when I realize that this 
woman must be a native New Yorker. 
Because as she beetles across the plaza 
toward her destination, she seems deter-
mined to avoid, or at least ignore, whatever 
it is that Times Square has become. 

what is your dream for Times Square? 
And what is your nightmare of Times 
Square? 

Back in the spring, as a thought experi-
ment, the Times Square Alliance, a non-
profit organization funded largely by local 
businesses, put those two questions to its 
board members and stakeholders, collected 
their answers, and printed them on for-

tunes to be inserted in fortune cookies as part of a giveaway. “Go 
ahead, take some,” Tim Tompkins, the president of the TSA, told 
me recently. “We have an excessive supply.” For the record, my 
“dream” cookie read, “A true civic center and real public space,” 
while my “nightmare” cookie read, “Overrun by costumed charac-
ters, solicitors & big sign hawkers”—which, come to think of it, are 
pretty close to my own dreams and nightmares for Times Square. 
Though, also for the record, had I been asked those questions 
directly, I would have answered, “My dream: never to be in Times 
Square” and “My nightmare: to be in Times Square.” 

The current jam-packed, galleria-fied iteration of Times Square 
has always reminded me of a place in Alberta, Canada, called Head-
Smashed-In Buffalo Jump: a high cliff where aboriginal hunters 
once cunningly maneuvered huge herds of bison into a narrow path-
way before forcing them off a cliff edge to their death. The famous 
Times Square “bow tie”—the area between 42nd Street and 47th 
Street where Broadway and Seventh Avenue intersect—similarly 
functions as a de facto tourist corral; a canyon, walled in by giant, 
garish video billboards, into which visitors to the city are hustled and 
contained. And this Head-Smashed-In version of Times Square, for 
what it is, has been undeniably successful: It takes up only 0.1 per-
cent of New York’s landmass but represents 11 percent of the city’s 
economic activity, generating $110 billion annually, which is larger 
than the amount generated in an entire city like Cincinnati. To  
a broader degree, Times Square is the geographical and symbolic 
center of New York’s vaunted tourism boom, which finds the city the 
most popular destination in the United States for international trav-
elers. The Faustian bargain, of course, has always seemed to be: Yes, 
you can save the center of your city from civic ruin with an infusion 
of bright lights and corporate money, but in return, you have to cede 
that space to people who don’t actually live here.

When the Times Square Alliance commissioned a survey in 2012 
and asked respondents for the word that best describes the area, the 
top three negative answers given by New Yorkers were “touristy,” 
“crowded,” and “noisy.” (The top three negative words among 
respondents nationwide: “crowded,” “touristy,” and “commercial-
ized”—even the tourists like to complain about the tourists.) These 

of the afternoon, no one’s throwing bottles, the victim is not really 
in mortal danger, and the crowd she’s being set upon by consists of 
Iron Man, two Minnie Mice, Elsa from Frozen, and Elmo.

I’ve just arrived in Times Square to investigate the seemingly 
lawless chaos that has, of late, attracted international attention and 
spurred a citywide—or at least tabloidwide—existential crisis. I’ve 
been here for exactly one minute. The woman, who made the obvi-
ous tactical error of entering Times Square with her phone visibly 
in hand, now finds herself corralled by costumed cartoon characters 
looking for tips in exchange for a photo. They encircle her with such 
familiarity that I honestly wonder for a moment if she’s yet another 
Minnie, newly arrived and not yet costumed for her shift. 

Throughout New York’s history, Times Square has served as a 
bellwether of the city’s current mood—as well as the perceptions of 
the city, both for those who live here and those who don’t. Once, 
Times Square was a high temple of glamour, the glowing heart of a 
go-go metropolis. Then it, like the city around it, slid into seedy 
decline. When much of New York was sleazy and dangerous, 
nowhere seemed sleazier or more dangerous than 42nd Street. And 
when Times Square came to feel too touristy, it mirrored a parallel 
worry that New York itself was losing some of its intrinsic grit. 
Times Square exists less as a crossroads than as a repository for our 
collective hopes and fears for the city. Now it’s entering a new 
phase— perhaps the strangest, most inscrutable one yet.

The most commonly voiced description of the New Times 
Square—the one midwifed into existence in the ’90s by Rudy 
Giuliani and Michael Eisner; the one that now welcomes more 
than 39 million tourists a year, roughly equivalent to the popula-
tion of Poland; the one we associate more with Mickey Mouse 
than Ratso Rizzo and Carson Daly than Damon Runyon—is 
“Disney fied.” This is almost never meant as a compliment. Yet 
even the area’s most cynical critic could never have envisioned a 
day when the famously sanitized, corporatized, Disneyfied Times 
Square would become infamous for a plague of vaguely mangy 
Disney characters shaking down tourists for money. 

And that’s not even to mention the puritan furor over the 
naked ladies with the painted bosoms. 

I n 1981, in an incident that attracted international attention and spurred a citywide existential crisis, a 26-year-old man from Connecticut was set upon, 
stripped naked, and chased by a jeering, bottle- throwing 
crowd in Times Square at night—“shadowy figures, 
drug peddlers, con artists, vagrants,” as the Times would 
later describe the area’s inhabitants—into a subway sta-
tion, then onto the tracks, where he died. In 2015, I’m 
watching the modern-day equivalent of that scenario 
play out, the only differences being that it’s the middle

are the exact sentiments that the Times Square Alliance is hoping 
to change. Its recent mandate, in part, is to give Times Square back 
to New Yorkers—or, at least, to reimagine Times Square as some-
thing New Yorkers might embrace. “It’s the geographical center of 
the city and a huge transportation hub,” says Sherry Dobbin, who 
was hired by the TSA in 2012 as its director of public art. “So the 
idea is: How do we also make it a cultural hub?” Sure, there’s Broad-
way, but there’s also no reason why you can’t stage cultural happen-
ings in Times Square that New Yorkers would actively seek out. To 
that end, Dobbins has instituted events like the Midnight Moment, 
when most of the billboards are given over for three minutes to  
a visiting artist. In a larger sense, the mandate is about reinventing 
Times Square in people’s imaginations as a place to gather in and 
enjoy, rather than to avoid or endure. “We want to have a larger 
conversation,” Tompkins says. “What’s the vision for this public 
space? What can Times Square be?”

The recent conversation about Times Square, of course, has not 
been quite so lofty. Instead, it’s been focused on those swarms of 
costumed characters that clog the pedestrian plaza. Or, more sen-
sationally, the so-called desnudas: women who pose for photos top-
less, wearing star-spangled body paint. They became a particular 
tabloid fixation this summer: “Too Much to Bare,” “Flesh Pit Pimps,” 
and “City’s in a Booby Trap” are just a few highlights from what 
proved to be a fruitful season for headline writers. Not to mention 
the guys who aggressively press you to purchase their dubious rap 
CDs and the fake Buddhist monks who wear orange robes and 
harass people for donations. In a recent TSA report outlining a plan 
to limit commercial activity to designated zones, one such activity 
is listed as simply “Fake Buddhist monks,” which is now apparently 
an official species in the Times Square ecosystem.

In response to the uproar, Police Commissioner William Bratton 
declared the city should “dig the whole damn thing up”—meaning 
rip up the newly installed pedestrian plazas and restore Broadway 
as a thoroughfare for cars. (Because, as all New Yorkers remember, 
Times Square before the pedestrian plazas was a pastoral oasis of 
urban civility.) Mayor de Blasio called this apparent epidemic in 
Times Square “unacceptable” and announced that he’d consider 
Bratton’s proposal, a statement that was met with almost universal 
horror. (“That’s not a solution. It’s a surrender,” Tompkins said at 
the time.) Meanwhile, Governor Cuomo, never one to let his finger 
be outwagged, warned of a return to the “bad old Times Square.” 
One thing seemed clear: Times Square, once a famously intractable 
civic conundrum that, 20 years ago, finally seemed to be solved, is 
suddenly in the midst of unsolving itself. 

The Giuliani Times Square that lives on in mythology is a squeaky-
clean, family-friendly, Disneyfied rejuvenation; the Bloomberg 
Times Square is a stubbornly progressive laboratory of urbanism, 
street closures, and lawn chairs. De Blasio’s Times Square is, well,  
a lot like de Blasio’s New York so far: a place ripe with old promise 
and new challenges, governed by an apparent hodgepodge of reac-
tive measures and plagued by the perception, unfairly or not, that 
it’s on the verge of spiraling out of control. Which brings us back to 
those two basic questions: What is your dream and your nightmare 
of Times Square? Think carefully, because they’re connected to a 
third, related question: What exactly do you want New York to be? 

jesse and yasmin are an attractive young couple who look way 
too cool to be in Times Square, and, as it turns out, they are. They’re 
from Queens, and they’re currently entertaining Jesse’s parents, 
Dan and Bonnie, who are visiting from San Francisco. The four of 
them are standing in the pedestrian plaza at 44th and Broadway, 
looking a little bewildered. There’s five of them, actually, including 
Jesse and Yasmin’s 9-week-old son, Ajax, who’s currently asleep in 
his stroller, blissfully immune to the cacophony. Dan, who has  
a large camera hanging around his neck, is studiously scanning the 

plaza. “I was hoping to get a picture of the baby with the naked lady,” 
he explains. “We thought that would be a good souvenir.” 

They’re a little too early for the desnudas—it’s only 2 p.m.—but 
by five, the plaza is teeming with picturesque nudity. If your knowl-
edge of the desnudas is through glancing at the Post or Daily News, 
you might expect that Times Square currently feels like a cross 
between a Dutch red-light district, a Wild West town, and a Caligu-
lan orgy. “An out-of-control influx of near-naked women jockeying 
for tips has turned Times Square into the XXX-Roads of the 
World—shocking children and incensing legions of tourists and 
New Yorkers alike” is how one Daily News story in August described 
it. It was hard to discern any genuine outrage in these stories, but 
they provided a perfect summertime distraction for scandal- hungry 
readers who love to hate Times Square, as well as feeding one of two 
compelling metanarratives, depending on your view: de Blasio’s 
continued fumbling or the tabloids’ incessant war on de Blasio. 

In reality, while there have been a few notable incidents—a fight 
between an unstable female passerby and one of the performers; the 
arrest of another performer for alleged prostitution and drug pos-
session—the atmosphere around the women seems friendly, even 
festive. They circulate around the plaza, smiling with the pleasantly 
distracted air of flight attendants, their outfits no more titillating 
than those of Vegas showgirls. (In winter, they add fur caps and 
warm leggings but keep the bare-chested patriotism visible, each 
looking like a one-woman American-Soviet summit.) They flirt. 
They tickle passing men with long red feathers. These women, 
nearly all of them Latina, from Colombia or Peru or, in a few cases, 
the Bronx, don’t love the slang term desnudas, preferring “painted 
performer.” Some wear bikini tops or pasties, and as for the ones who 



o c t o b e r  5 –1 8 ,  2 0 1 5  |  n e w  y o r k    31

go topless—as women are legally entitled to do in New York—their 
nudity is so obscured by body paint that you typically have to glance 
twice to confirm it. In fact, Sports Illustrated features the same 
brand of body-painted licentiousness nearly every year in its fairly 
chaste swimsuit issue.

Amanda Roman, who’s 23 and from the Bronx, has been out in 
Times Square, topless, since last September. She comes with Chris 
Olivieri, who’s 25 and has been working with women in Times 
Square—holding their belongings, watching their backs, sharing 
their tips—for the past four years. “My uncle was the one that came 
up with the idea,” he says. “We used to go to parties in the Domino 
Sugar Factory and they’d have body-painted girls handing out 
drinks and taking pictures with people. It was exciting. So we were 
like, ‘We could try this. The Naked Cowboy’s out there.’ So we tried 
it one day, and it was a big success.” I ask him why they chose Times 
Square, and he says plainly, “It’s the crossroads of the world.” Over 
four years, he’s never had a problem. But this summer, everything 
changed. Olivieri is disappointed in de Blasio’s scolding—“I voted 
for him,” he says—but he blames the discord on newcomers: women, 
many of them visiting New York from outside the country, who saw 
what he and his women were doing and copied it. “Instead of know-
ing the concept, they carried themselves a different way,” he says.  

As for Amanda, she heard about the job from Chris’s uncle; you 
can average about $300 a day, but at first she was apprehensive. “It’s 
something you have to experience for yourself,” she says. “It can sound 
kind of scary. But it’s actually fun. I like it best when people are look-
ing at the picture and smiling and laughing with their family about 
it.” She’s found a way to cope with the long hours working topless at 
the crossroads of the world: “I meditate. I do a standing meditation.” 

Amanda and Chris met in Times Square, and now they’re dating— 
a modern Times Square love story. Frankly, they seem like obvious 
candidates for a reality show. “I would love that!” Amanda says. 

It’s funny watching the desnudas and the costumed characters 
cluster together in the plaza, and not just for the obvious comic jux-
taposition of topless women alongside Minions. These twin phe-
nomena almost cartoonishly personify two very different incarna-
tions of Times Square—they’re like the ghosts of Times Square Past 
and Times Square Present, risen to hustle side by side. The desnu-
das, with their feathered fans and demure come-ons, recall less the 
sleazy, triple-X-porn days of Times Square than an earlier era  
of vaudeville theaters and bawdy burlesque—an era when, as James 
Traub writes in The Devil’s Playground, his definitive history of 
Times Square, “the burlesque theater spilled out into the street in 
the form of barkers and steerers who tried to whip the customers 
inside; giant posters of half-naked girls blared from under the mar-
quees.” This was in 1932. 

The cartoon characters, of course, seem more like weird mutant 
offspring of the modern, Disneyfied Times Square; as a visual 
metaphor for cheery commercialism run amok, they could not be 
more poignant, like a George Saunders story come to life. They 
hover with eerily implacable smiles, much like the official versions 
you’d encounter at Disney World. Yet, as a friend, a lifelong New 
Yorker, remarks: “They always take the mask off when they ask you 
for tips—to remind you that there’s a human inside.” 

Francisco Lopez, 40, is a Mickey. He’s originally from Mexico, 
but he’s lived in the U.S. for 25 years, in California, then New 
York, now New Jersey. He lists many of the same factors most  
of the characters will give you if you ask them about the work: 
It’s fun. He likes making children smile. The costume is very hot. 
“Then the ladies came, and problems started,” he says. He’s not 
offended by the topless women. They just tend to siphon his tips. 
He’s lucky to get one or two dollars from a family, whereas the 
women, he claims, can get $20 per photo. “One time, a man said 
to me, ‘I have no money!’ ” Lopez says. “I say, ‘Fine, no problem, 
I take the picture with your kids.’ Then I see that same man take 
a picture with a woman and give her $20! Then she asked for 
$20 more. He gave her $40!”

The costumed characters tend to work in concert; when some-
one stops to pose for a picture with one of them, the other char-
acters quickly cluster, so your snapshot with Smurfette turns into 
a group shot with seven or eight characters, all of whom expect 
to be tipped. Some people pay up happily. Some pay up less than 
happily. Some just walk away. “I’m Mickey Mouse, and Mickey 
Mouse is America,” says Lopez. “So that’s what I say when I ask 
for tips.” He points to himself and his iconic costume, then says 
in his heavy accent: “I say ‘America!’ ”

A
t the end of the 19th century, before there was  
a Times Square, the muddy intersection at Broad-
way and 42nd Street was known as Long acre 
Square, a locus of literal horse-trading. A few Broad-
way theaters had already risen along the stretch 
north of 42nd Street, including the elder Oscar 
Hammerstein’s fabled Olympia Theatre. The area 

was a burgeoning entertainment district, but it did not yet have an 
identity. All of that changed on April 8, 1904, when it was rechris-
tened Times Square by mayoral decree, on the occasion of the arrival 
on 42nd Street of a building that would house the New York Times. 
Times Square enjoyed a few decades of glamour as part of “The 
Great White Way,” then was felled by a string of events: Prohibition 
(which replaced fancy dining establishments with mob-run speak-
easies), the rise of cinema (which converted grand old theaters to 
populist movie halls), and the Depression (which suffocated upscale 
entertainment and ushered in the age of burlesque).

“Times Square has been a place of illusion and fantasy, where the 
view backward conveniently benchmarked the present and not 
infrequently appeared better,” writes scholar Lynne Sagalyn in 
Times Square Roulette. She identifies several types of Times Square 
nostalgist, including “skeptics,” who view all change with suspicion; 
“retrogrades,” who long for the seedier past because they feel that it’s 
intrinsically authentic; “wistfuls,” who recognize that change is inevi-
table, even beneficial; and “resilients,” whose “optimism comes from 
faith in the city’s unpredictable ways.” Where you fall on that spec-
trum will largely determine how you view any sort of change in 
Times Square, and which previous era you find yourself most in love 
with. “For me, that moment is the ’30s, ’40s, and ’50s—what I think 
of as A. J. Liebling New York,” says Traub, in reference to the famed 
New Yorker writer who chronicled the area’s more colorful denizens. 
“That’s when Times Square was no longer glamorous but it wasn’t 
yet dangerous. It was seedy—in a wonderful kind of way.” 

By the 1950s, the raffish, romantic underworld was subsumed by 
a more malevolent air. Its proximity to Penn Station, plus the open-
ing of the Port Authority Bus Terminal in 1950, ensured a stream 
of faceless thrill-seekers that Times Square and 42nd Street were 
all too eager to accommodate. In 1960, a Times story headlined 
“Life on W. 42d St. a Study in Decay” announced that the area had 
become “an enigma to New Yorkers concerned with the deteriora-
tion of the midway of Manhattan.” By the ’70s, the area’s most noto-
rious chronicler was Travis Bickle in Taxi Driver, muttering about 
how “all the animals come out at night—whores, skunk pussies, 
buggers, queens, fairies, dopers, junkies, sick, venal. Someday a real 
rain’ll come and wash all this scum off the streets.” 

The conundrum of what to do with Times Square plagued six 
consecutive mayoral administrations, starting in the 1960s. Ideas to 
save the area were forwarded and rejected in turn, including one 
fanciful rejuvenation called “The City at 42nd Street” in 1978, with 
a proposal that included tearing down most of the existing buildings 
and replacing them with two city blocks’ worth of theme park, 
enclosed under glass and circled by a monorail. Mayor Ed Koch 
squelched the idea, in part because, as he said, “New York cannot 
and should not compete with Disneyland … People do not come to 
midtown Manhattan to take a ride on some machine.” New Yorkers, 
he declared, want “seltzer instead of orange juice,” in reference to 
Disney’s Florida locale. Then, in July 1995, this long- standing prob-
lem was finally addressed. Mayor Giuliani signed a deal that would 
close the remaining porn establishments on 42nd Street and cement 
a new partnership with Disney, which had agreed to revitalize one 
of the area’s derelict live theaters. A new, family-friendly Times 
Square was born in a great, cleansing flood of orange juice. 

twenty years later, it’s been easy for New Yorkers to assume 
that Times Square is no longer an issue, largely because many people 
think of it as no longer part of New York. It’s more like Checkpoint 
Charlie: a cordoned-off chunk of enemy territory in the middle of 
the city. “A college roommate of mine once said that Middle America 
thinks that Times Square is all about New York, and New Yorkers 
think it’s all about Middle America,” Tompkins told me.

Around 2008, however, this started to change. First, the new 
TKTS booth opened, with its inviting tier of red steps offering one of 
the more spectacular views of the city. Then, in 2009, Mayor Bloom-
berg installed the first of the proposed pedestrian plazas on Broad-

way, a move that was applauded by progressive urbanists and opened 
the possibility that Times Square could once again become a kind of 
civic stage; a place where people, including New Yorkers, might 
gather to see wondrous things. From Hubert’s Flea Circus in the ’20s 
to its sleaziest ’70s porn-palace days—when shops like Peep land 
advertised films with straightforward descriptions like “Man fucks  
a hen”—the enticement of Times Square has always been the same: 
Come see something you can’t see anywhere else. The story of Times 
Square’s recent decline—or, at least, the rise of a set of circumstances 
that’s led to this summer’s dig-the-damn-thing-up panic—is con-
nected to a loss of that allure, which has been replaced by a citywide 
sense of neglect. New Yorkers who don’t have to be there for work 
more or less have turned their backs on the area. And by most 
accounts, Times Square has never been a priority for Mayor de Bla-
sio, who is driven by the determination that Bloomberg, his prede-
cessor, focused too squarely on Manhattan’s amenities (true), and a 
less valiant notion that the plazas are part of Bloomberg’s legacy and 
thus not worth championing (questionable). 

The tourists, meanwhile—all 39 million of them—are having no 
trouble figuring out what Times Square is for. To them, it still exists 
as a stage, but one on which they are the main attraction. The TKTS 
booth, as New York critic Justin Davidson has written, puts the whole 
sparkling city on display yet also “gratifies the narcissistic sense that 
each of us is starring in a real-time biopic.” Once, what was offered 
in Times Square was New York in all its glamour or all its vice; now 
what you’re watching onstage is yourself, with New York as the back-
drop. “You haven’t been to New York until you’ve been to Times 
Square!” declares Cat W, who visited last year from Austria, to her 
fellow travelers on the website TripAdvisor. “Standing here feels like 
you are starring in a blockbuster movie, starring YOU!”

Which is why it’s impossible to talk about the Elmos, or the des-
nudas, or Times Square, without talking about all the cameras—
specifically, the fact that nearly every single person is now armed 
with a personal camera and is looking for something interesting to 
photograph. In 2014, Times Square was the most-Instagrammed 
site in New York City and the third-most-Instagrammed place on 
Earth. A major selling point for the enormous billboards, in fact, is 
that they deliver “multiple impressions,” because they’re photo-
graphed so frequently and those photos are shared on social media. 
One popular billboard allows you to gather below as part of a crowd, 
watch yourself onscreen, pose for a picture, then see that photo on 
the billboard, so you can snap a photo of that photo. 

And so the costumed characters and desnudas are a distinctly 
modern addition to the same storied lineage of the three-card-
monte hustlers and con artists in the Times Square of yore. The one 
thing that Amanda Roman and Elmo inarguably have in common 
is that (a) they’re both interesting to look at and (b) they both exist 
primarily for you to take a picture of. The new Times Square hustle 
isn’t offering you sex or the promise of riches—it’s offering you 
something cool or funny that you can Instagram. 

If nothing else, these street performers have served to finally win 
back the city’s attention—of both the residents and the current 
administration. Since the backlash to his comments, Commissioner 
Bratton has claimed that his outburst—“dig the whole damn thing 
up”—was a calculated effort to “smoke people out” on their positions 
regarding the plaza. The mayor, in turn, announced the formation 
of a task force, headed by Bratton and Carl Weisbrod, chairman of 

Times Square has always served as a bellwether of the  
city’s current mood—as well as the perceptions of the city,  
both for those who live here and those who don’t.



o c t o b e r  5 –1 8 ,  2 0 1 5  |  n e w  y o r k    33

the City Planning Commission, to determine 
a course of action; the task force recom-
mended creating specific zones with new 
rules that will regulate desnudas, Elmos, and, 
yes, fake Buddhist monks. “Many of the chal-
lenges today are a product of the success of 
Times Square,” Weisbrod told me. The task 
force estimates, though, that it may take 
another year to determine the regulations.

In the meantime, the post-Giuliani, post-
Bloomberg, de Blasian Times Square, with 
its TKTS stairs and partially completed 
pedestrian plazas, has been languishing as  
a half-built stage. In an office high above the 
square, the TSA has been brainstorming one 
bunch of possibilities: They have a wall cov-
ered with yellow stickies of ideas, including 
pop-up bookstores, Broadway karaoke, and 
virtual- reality tours. Down below, a different 
show has bubbled up, hoping to draw your 
camera lens and wrest a few bucks from your 
wallet. If history has taught us anything, it’s 
that the Times Square stage is going to be 
filled by something, one way or the other. 
Right now, the city—both the administration 
and the residents who long ago wrote the 
area off—just needs to step up and reclaim it.

S
omething is happening 
in Times Square. Someone’s 
painting a naked black man 
in white paint and a naked 
white woman in black paint. 
Nearby, two more naked peo-
ple are holding a frame around themselves; they’re 
painted, rather expertly, to look like The Persistence 

of Memory, by Salvador Dalí. They’re part of a demonstration 
called #ArtTranscends, organized by the artist Dani Fonseca, 
who’s worked at Fashion Week and with Lady Gaga. She orga-
nized a few body-paint-artist friends to protest the negative press 
that body painting has gotten thanks to the desnudas. One of the 
artists, Yvonne MacInnis, is responsible for the Dalí painting. 
“We thought that people who’ve come to Times Square should 
see something really cool,” she says. I ask about her connection 
to the naked people being painted a few feet away, and she says, 
“Oh, that’s not us. That’s something else.”

“I inadvertently started the desnudas thing!” announces Andy 
Golub, the other, unrelated body-paint artist. Golub says he painted 
two naked models in Times Square back in 2011, got arrested, 
fought the charges, and won, on grounds that public nudity is legal 
as part of artistic display. As he sees it, this was the inspiration for 
Chris Olivieri and all the feathered women who followed. “But I’ve 
come back to clarify that it’s not just boobs but penises and vaginas 
that are allowed as well, in the name of art,” Golub says. 

I’m going to stop and say something heretical: Times Square is 
kind of fun. Especially when you’re not rushing through it but actu-
ally have some time to linger. I don’t mean in the Olive Garden or 
the Hard Rock Cafe; I mean in the streets, in the plaza, in the public 
square. In the past few weeks, I spent more time loitering in Times 
Square than in all my previous years in New York—including three 
years spent working on its periphery—and I assure you, there’s 
always something happening in Times Square. Sometimes it’s 
something annoying. Often it is something weird. Occasionally it’s 
something delightful. It might be guerrilla surrealist body art, or a 
Japanese singer who brings out an amp for a few ballads before 

disappearing, or two guys shooting a video for Clint Black, featur-
ing Times Square denizens holding signs like Bob Dylan in “Subter-
ranean Homesick Blues.” The best part about watching the desnu-
das at work is seeing tourists stroll past, glance over, then do a 
double-take: Wait, am I seeing what I think I’m seeing? They’re 
experiencing something legitimately unexpected and  memorable—
which is to say, perhaps the most authentically New York–ian thing 
they may encounter during their entire visit here. 

A few more expertly painted naked models arrive to join the 
Dalí painting: a steampunk couple, a kind of demonic mermaid, 
and a futuristic pair painted blue and gold with disco-ball hel-
mets. Watching them, it occurs to me that, from Andy Golub to 
the desnudas to the disco-helmeted blue-and-gold protesters,  
a mini-epic of New York is being enacted, right here in Times 
Square, sketched out in body paint. A brazen act of public protest 
has somehow inspired some opportunistic capitalist hustling, 
which in turn has spurred this outpouring of genuine artistic 
showmanship. It’s like a tiny Times Square fable—a reminder 
that, like a patch of grass breaking through concrete, the spirit 
of New York can pop up anywhere.

Spider-Man runs over to take a photo of two naked people 
painted as Persistence of Memory; this is something even he hasn’t 
seen before. As a bigger crowd gathers, I realize that, just a few 
blocks away, there’s a whole bunch of other people who are miss-
ing this but probably gawking in wonder at something equally 
remarkable. I’m reminded of what Shannon, a genial liaison who 
watches the action from his perch in a Times Square info booth, 
told me about a young lady he spotted one day. “She was walking 
by, just looking up and smiling,” he says, “and I was like, ‘What are 
you smiling about?’ And she looked around at Times Square and 
was like: ‘This. Everything.’ ” ■PH

HERE IS A PHOTO BY 
Pete Souza, the White House’s 
canny and peripatetic photog-

rapher, that surfaces from time to time 
online. The setting is Marine One, and it 
features a modest cast of five. Valerie 
Jarrett, dressed in a suit of blazing pink, 
is staring at her cell phone. Barack 
Obama, twisted around in his seat, is lis-
tening to a conversation between his 
then–body guy, Reggie Love, and Patrick 
Gaspard, one of his then–top advisers. 
Obama’s former deputy press secretary, 
Bill Burton, is looking on too, with just 
the mildest hint of a grin on his face.

In many ways, it’s a banal shot—just 
another photo for the White House 
In stagram feed, showing the president 
and his aides busily attending to matters 
of state. Stare at it a second longer, though, 
and a subtle distinction comes into focus: 
Everyone onboard is black. “We joked that 
it was Soul Plane,” says Burton. “And we’ve 
often joked about it since—that it was the 
first time in history only black people were 
on that helicopter.”

Souza snapped that shot on August 9, 
2010, but it didn’t make any prominent 
appearances in the mainstream press 
until mid-2012, when it appeared in The 
New York Times Magazine. The following 
summer, July 2013, the president had a 
group of civil-rights leaders come visit 
him in the Roosevelt Room of the White 
House, and the optics, as they like to say in 
politics, were similar: An all-star cast of 
minorities (African-American and Latino 
this time) gathered in a historic place to 
which the barriers to entry were once 
insuperably high. 

But this was not a meeting the partici-
pants laughed about afterward. When 
Obama opened up the floor, everyone 
spoke about what they’d witnessed in the 
2012 election: how states that limited

I understood the tight- 
rope from the beginning.

it felt like he was  
president of  
everyone except  
black people.”

Columbia University. “Your man is in office, and you have this 
whole movement around criminal-justice reform asserting black 
people’s humanity?”

Obama is hardly uncomprehending of these concerns. One 
can hear it in his rhetoric on race these days, which has become 
much more lyrical, personal, explicit. “Amazing Grace,” he sang 
in Charleston. “Racism, we are not cured of,” he told Marc 
Maron, “and it’s not just a matter of it not being polite to say 
‘n-----’ in public,” using the full word. This summer, Obama vis-
ited a prison, the first president to do so, and commuted the 
sentences of 46 nonviolent drug offenders. Last year, he started 
the My Brother’s Keeper initiative, which zeros in on programs 
within federal agencies that can help young men of color. He is 
now trying, with the improbable cooperation of congressional 
Republicans, to pass a bill on criminal-justice reform.

Still, the question many African-American leaders are now 
asking is what his efforts will amount to, and whether they’re 
sufficient. At a panel about African-American millennials in 
August, the journalist Charlayne Hunter-Gault made note of 
Obama’s recent emphasis on race matters and asked the group 
if it was “too little, too late.” Their responses, not surprisingly, 
were mixed. At the Aspen Ideas Festival this summer, Jarrett 
fielded a similar question from Walter Isaacson, the writer and 
head of the Aspen Institute. He noted that some  Americans 
thought Obama publicly engaged with issues of race only “half-

way.” Her reply was swift, pointed, and poignant. “I think you 
have to ask yourself: Why is that all on him?” 

Just after November 5, 2008, there was, in this country, a 
brief spell of racial euphoria. The streets on Election Eve were 
filled with jubilant strangers hugging and kissing one another. 
The word postracial got tossed around a lot (by whites, it must 
be said, far more than blacks). A Gallup poll released two days 
after Obama’s victory declared that two-thirds of Americans said 
“a solution to relations between blacks and whites will eventually 
be worked out,” the highest percentage Gallup has measured on 
this question. 

Going into the Oval Office, Obama had given one of the most 
extraordinary speeches about race this country had ever heard 
from a politician. Granted, he’d had no choice: His former pastor, 
the  Reverend Jeremiah Wright, had preached a sermon in 2003 
that included the words “God damn America,” which were incon-
veniently caught on videotape. But Obama’s response—a 
37-minute speech in Philadelphia that patiently put these words 
in historical context—was risky, audacious, possibly even contra-
indicated. “There were many cowardly ways to handle that situ-

adviser on green jobs

voter-registration drives and early-voting initiatives had 
left many African-Americans off the rolls; how strict new 
laws concerning IDs had prevented many minorities from 
voting and created hours-long lines at the polls. The answer 
was clear: legislation to restore the Voting Rights Act. The 
Supreme Court had just overturned a key provision of the 
landmark civil-rights legislation the month before.

But Obama’s response was equally clear: Nothing could 
be done. Not in this political climate, not under these cir-
cumstances. Congress would never allow it.

The group was stunned. As they’d stumped for Obama, 
one of the many talking points they’d used to turn out the 
black vote was the threat of disenfranchisement, the pos-
sibility that the  Voting Rights Act was in jeopardy. Yet here 
was Obama telling them that a bill addressing this vital 
issue didn’t stand a chance.

These proximal events—the publication of a historic photo 
in a major news outlet, a demoralizing discussion about the 
prospects of amending our voting laws—may seem unrelated. But 
to many who’ve watched this White House for the last six and three-
quarter years, particularly with an eye toward race, the two events 
are finely intertwined. They would more likely say: One cannot 
have that photo without a massive reaction to that photo. In a coun-
try whose basic genetic blueprint includes the same crooked muta-
tions that made slavery and Jim Crow  possible, it is not possible to 
have a black president surrounded by black aides on Marine One 
without paying a price. And the price that Obama has had to pay—
and, more important, that African-Americans have had to pay—is 
one of caution, moderation, and at times compromised policies: 
The first black president could do only so much, and say only so 
much, on behalf of other African- Americans. That is the bitter-
sweet irony of the first black presidency.

But now, as Obama’s presidency draws to a close, African- 
American intellectuals and civil-rights leaders have grown increas-
ingly vocal in their discontents. They frame them, for the most part, 
with love and respect. But current events have broken their hearts 
and stretched their patience. A proliferation of videos document-
ing the murders of unarmed black men and women—by the very 
people charged with their safety—has given rise to a whole move-
ment defined by three words and a hashtag: #BlackLivesMatter. 

“That’s one of the fundamental paradoxes of Obama’s presi-
dency—that we have the Black Lives Matter movement under 
a black president,” says Fredrick Harris, a political scientist at

ation,” says Van Jones, Obama’s former special adviser for 
green jobs, “but he chose the most courageous one.” The 
speech got 1.2 million hits within the first 24 hours of being 
posted on YouTube. 

What one says as a candidate is one thing; what one says as 
president is another. Six months into Obama’s tenure, a 
reporter asked the president what he thought of the arrest of 
Harvard’s Henry Louis Gates Jr., one of the most famous 
African-American intellectuals in the United States, who had 
been taken into custody for trying to unstick the stubborn 
front door of his own home. Obama replied that although he 
didn’t have all the facts, he thought the Cambridge police had 
“acted stupidly.” Within minutes, the world seemed to come 
off its hinges, with Fox and its cousins—even some of its in-
laws in the mainstream press— declaiming that Obama had 
insufficient respect for law enforcement. Obama dialed back 
his comments, proposing that Gates and the police officer 
meet at the White House over beers. 

“There was the president of the United States,” says Jones, 
“escorted by the white vice-president, sitting at a little table 
with an arguably racist white beat cop from Boston, like 
some little kid in time-out in a kindergarten class.” The inci-
dent would subsequently become known as “the beer summit.” “I 
don’t think anyone has really tried to think through the harm that 
that whole incident inflicted on the country,” he continues. “The 
courageous president we had voted for disappeared.” Jones says 
that a number of White House staffers, particularly those of color, 
wished the president hadn’t done it. “I wish he had gone out and 
said, ‘I want to clarify what I said about the police behaving fool-
ishly. What I meant was: They behaved damn foolishly. I’m going 
back to work.’ ”  

It didn’t help that Obama’s brain trust—at least in the 
 beginning—seemed to be made extremely uncomfortable by race 
matters. “Sometimes liberals think, Because I’m fair-minded, I 
know how to handle race relations,” says Marc Morial, the head of 
the National Urban League. “No. Handling race relations means 
knowing how to handle alligators and crocodiles. Apart from 
 Valerie Jarrett, there weren’t a lot of African-American advisers in 
there who were experienced in dealing with race.” He thinks for a 
moment. “Or white advisers,” he adds. “There are lots of white 
advisers who have experience in dealing with race relations. But 

I think the David Axelrod–Rahm Emanuel axis didn’t understand 
it.” Barbara Arnwine, the recently retired executive director of the 
Lawyers’ Committee for Civil Rights Under Law, says people 
would refer to Obama’s advisers as “the Great White Wall.” She 
adds: “During his first term, I thought Bill Clinton was more 
directly engaged with the black and civil-rights community on 
policy matters than Obama was—and a lot less defensive.” 

The beer summit was the last the public heard from Obama 
about race for quite some time. Daniel Q. Gillion, a political sci-
entist at the University of Pennsylvania, later analyzed the record 
of the president’s public comments and found he’d spoken less 
about race in his first two years than any Democratic president 
since JFK. “Whenever I gave an interview, I felt the pressure to 
say, ‘All Americans, all Americans,’ ” says Jones, who resigned 
from the White House in September 2009 after  revelations about 
his previous political affiliations and beliefs, which were more 
radical than the White House would have liked. “There was this 
anxiety that we shouldn’t look too concerned about blacks. I 
understood the tightrope from the beginning. He’s the president 

of all people. But sometimes it felt like he was president of 
everyone except black people.”

One can argue that Obama’s hands were tied from the 
very beginning. This country is still a vexed mess when it 
comes to race. Even during the first campaign, Obama’s 
advisers were painfully aware of the electorate’s misgiv-
ings. They were hard to miss, if you were in the polling 
business. The Democratic pollster Stan Greenberg tells an 
illustrative tale: When his firm surveyed hundreds of likely 
voters in Macomb County, Michigan (fabled for its dense 
concentration of Reagan Democrats), “they were acutely 
conscious that Obama was African- American. What they 
said was, ‘Is he going to govern for everybody? Or is he 
going to govern for his people?’ That was the critical, piv-
otal question for them.” These crucial voters wanted to see 
Obama as a symbol of progress, of how far we’d come. Yes, 
we can. They didn’t want to see him as a symbol of disaf-
fection, of how far we had to go. “I am sure the campaign 
was conscious of it,” says Greenberg, “and he had to deal 
with it if he was going to sustain their support—governing 
not for a  particular group, but for everybody.”

These same reservations were evident—maybe even 

Obama has a famous 
swag. It’s a signal he sends 
with his walk that says, ‘I got 
this.’ He had it with 
trade, immigration, 
health care. But  
he doesn’t have it 
when he talks 
about race.”

Too often, he uses these  
occasions not to push for

law enforcement but to push 

a narrative  
that black  
people should

intensified—in the immediate aftermath of the election. That Gal-
lup survey that trumpeted our optimism? It also found deep streaks 
of pessimism. Only 32 percent of McCain voters felt proud of 
Obama. More than half, 56 percent, felt “afraid.” By 2010, the tea 
party was  ascendant, peddling racist imagery. “No one expected the 
pictures of him eating watermelon, the pictures making him look 
like a monkey, the Sambos,” says Arnwine. “The racism was so base.”

Obama’s election brought out not just the best of the country, in 
other words, but its worst. “Portions of white America have literally 
had a nervous breakdown over a black man being in the White 
House,” says Anthea Butler, a religious-studies professor at the 
 University of Pennsylvania. “I mean, here people are, acting so sur-
prised about Donald Trump’s popularity. Hello? He’s the one who 
asked Obama for a birth certificate!”

Writing in The Atlantic in 2012, Ta-Nehisi Coates tried to show, 
brick by brick, how the Republican rhetoric of the Obama years has 
been racialized in ways both subtle and explicit. He noted that 
Obamacare was framed as “reparations.” (Bill Clinton’s stab at uni-
versal health care, meanwhile, was generally framed as an excess of 
“big government.”) In January 2012, Newt Gingrich declared that 
“more people have been put on food stamps by Barack Obama than 
any president in history,” when in fact that distinction goes to 
George W. Bush. When Obama criticized Arizona’s draconian 
immigration laws, Iowa congressman Steve King said Obama “has 
a default mechanism in him … that favors the black person.” And 
in response to the Gates incident, Glenn Beck said that Obama “has 
a deep-seated  hatred for white people or the white culture.” 

This was the media, Congress, and electorate that Obama had to 
contend with. How much, realistically, could he explicitly say or do 
for African-Americans under such circumstances? “I’m deeply 
 conflicted over this fact,” Coates told James Bennet, editor of The 
Atlantic, in a public discussion. “It’s smart politics for him not to 
talk about race.”

No one contests that Obama is navigating rather treacher-
ous political narrows, but his critics still believe he could have 
done things differently. “All presidents bear burdens of some 
sort,” says Fredrick Harris, the political scientist at Columbia. 
“Race was one with Obama. But from my perspective, why 
should black constituents bear the  burden of his risk aversion 
when it comes to issues of race?”

Indeed, some civil-rights leaders see the Black Lives Matter 
movement (and its abiding impact on the 2016 campaign) as a 
rebuke to Obama, a symptom of his inability thus far to satisfacto-
rily address racial inequality in this country. “By now, it’s safe to say 
that black people have wanted Obama to do more,” says Alicia 

Garza, one of the movement’s co-founders. “For the last eight years, 
everything and nothing has been about race.” She looks at the 
deaths of young black men and women we’ve recently  witnessed—
children, some of them, with Skittles in their pockets—and feels 
deep disappointment in Obama’s reactions to them. “Too often,” 
she says, “he uses these occasions not to push for greater account-
ability within law enforcement, but to push a narrative that black 
people should behave more responsibly.” She understands that law 
enforcement is a constituency the president cannot afford to alien-
ate. “But that assumption erases the power dynamic in this coun-
try,” she says, “and it places the responsibility on black people, who 
are without economic power, political power, and social power to 
impact their own conditions.” 

These law-enforcement excesses are set against the larger back-
drop of an incarceration pandemic: If you are an African-American 
male, you stand a one in three chance of cycling through prison at 
some point. But the president’s record on this matter has been 
mixed. Yes, it was under Obama that Congress passed the Fair Sen-
tencing Act in 2010, which reduced the disparities in punishments 
for crack- and powder-cocaine possession. But the law did not apply 
retroactively. After the law passed, thousands still languished in con-
finement though they no longer met the criteria of such harsh sen-
tences, and Obama, who had the unique power of clemency to set 
them free, wasn’t doing so. “The administration could have acted 
much more boldly to commute the sentences of the thousands of 
people still serving time under the old, unfair crack law,” says Jeremy 
Haile, federal advocacy counsel for the Sentencing Project.

The other policy disappointment—not unrelated—that inevita-
bly comes up is the issue of African-American unemployment. Talk 
to black lawmakers, and this is the first thing they mention: How 
they wish Obama had made extra efforts to strengthen job-creation 
programs in their struggling districts, where some of those high-
profile murders were taking place. The White House would usually 
respond to this complaint with “a rising tide lifts all boats.” The 
answer always left Jim Clyburn, a South Carolina Democrat who 
ranks third in the House, underwhelmed. “If a boat has several 
holes in the bottom,” he told me, “it ain’t lifting.” 

But the most wrenching reactions to Obama centered on how 
he did or did not respond to the numerous highly visible acts of 
violence and injustice against African- Americans during his ten-
ure. Charles Coleman Jr., a civil-rights attorney in New York, talked 
about two critical moments in Obama’s presidency. “So, George 
Zimmerman is acquitted,” he says about the man who killed Tray-
von Martin. “There is a significant faction of the country that’s at a 
loss: How do we have a  dialogue on this? And the president delivers 
an incredible speech.” Extemporaneously, from the looks of it. He 
said Trayvon could have been him 35 years ago. “It represented the 
pinnacle of where he’s been on race. It was an example of the presi-
dent speaking to black America as a black American, from within 
our community. He made us feel like he really does get it.”

Then there was Ferguson. Even by Obama standards, the presi-
dent seemed to react to the shooting of an unarmed black man and 
the subsequent anger with unusual caution. Obama expressed his 
distress about the incident, but he also pleaded for calm and chas-
tised those who rioted—a reaction that devastated many African- 
Americans, who thought he was emphasizing the stereotype of 
black lawlessness. “It delegitimized the frustrations of black people 
and the reasons for their frustration,” says Coleman. “It fed into the 
narrative of, ‘These are angry black people in the streets.’ ”

Jon Favreau, the president’s former head speechwriter, under-
stands this point of view but believes the president had little choice. 
“An American city was on fire,” he says. “He’s the president. He 
doesn’t want to further incite violence or instability.” He says people 
often fail to grasp this: how a few words from the president can 
crater the stock market or exacerbate a conflict.

Every black person has 
this job whether they want  
it or not—and he’s the 

president. History 
is going to think  
it’s his job.”

american politics and society, 
columbia university

Why should black  
constituents bear the  burden  

of his risk aversion  
when it comes  

to issues of race?”

As for the overall arc of Obama’s rhetoric on race, Favreau rejects 
the conventional wisdom: “There’s this view that he was coura-
geous to speak out about race before he got to the White House, 
then he was quiet, and then, after the 2014 midterms, he was free 
to speak again,” he says. “I never bought into that theory. He had to 
take on events as they came. There was a financial crisis. An oil spill. 
Afghanistan. Bin Laden. Health care.” Then came a visible succes-
sion of killings of young, unarmed African-Americans. And Obama 
addressed those too. “I find it frustrating when people say he’s find-
ing his voice and that he’s finally comfortable” discussing race, 
agrees Jarrett. “He has always felt perfectly comfortable speaking 
out when he thought it could make a difference.”

Paul Butler, who worked at the Department of Justice under both 
Bill Clinton and George W. Bush, says much of the frustration 
African-Americans were expressing post-Ferguson was the culmi-
nation of many years’ worth of irritation, not over Obama’s caution, 
necessarily, but his penchant for “respectability politics.” (“Brothers 
should pull up their pants” was one of his more memorable lines 
during the campaign.) That a man with the power to address struc-
tural inequality would instead talk about behavior really rankled, 
Butler says, echoing Garza. He cites Obama’s commencement 
speech at Morehouse College in 2013, in which the president said, 
“Nobody cares if you suffered some discrimination.”

 “It’s impossible imagining Hillary going to Wellesley or Smith 
and saying, ‘Stop whining about the patriarchy and the glass ceiling. 
Nobody cares,’ ” says Butler, who now teaches at Georgetown Uni-
versity Law Center. “She would not say it.”

“Yes, she would!” protests Jarrett. “She’d talk about resilience! If 
you read the whole speech, it was to strengthen them, to make 
them feel resilient.”

Butler disagrees. “Obama has a famous swag,” he says. “It’s a 
signal he sends to us with his walk that says, ‘I got this.’ He had it 
with trade, with immigration, with health care. But he doesn’t have 
it when he talks about race.” 

How does he look then? I ask.
“He looks tired,” says Butler. “He looks weary. It’s almost like he 

suffers from the racial fatigue whites say they suffer from.”

“During that first election season,” says Nicole Austin- Hillery, 
the director of the Brennan Center for Justice’s Washington, D.C., 
office, “my husband and I would go to dinner parties in lovely homes 
with all these super-well-educated African- Americans, and so many 
of them talked about how, ‘Oh, Obama’s going to do this on race, he’s 
going to do this for black America.’ And my husband and I were the 
only two who said he has to govern the way he ran—and he didn’t 
run on racial-justice issues or reform issues.”

It’s possible—reasonable to assume, even—that Obama never 
wanted to initiate a huge national conversation about race. Maybe 
he simply wanted to be a great president, defining “great” however 

he wished. In The Price of the Ticket: Barack Obama and the Rise 
and Decline of Black Politics, Fredrick Harris notes that Obama 
didn’t really speak about racial inequality during his first presiden-
tial campaign unless he had to. His most impassioned speech on 
the subject, back in June 2007, came after he’d spent a quarter of 
the year trailing Hillary Clinton among black supporters. “It grew 
stronger when he needed black support to shore up his viability as 
a candidate,” writes Harris. “It grew dimmer after black supporters 
got behind his candidacy en masse.” 

Even in his speeches about race, Obama often pushes a more 
universalist message. In his commemorative remarks in Selma this 
spring, for instance, he turned the marchers’ struggle into a meta-
phor for all struggles of the disempowered in the United States: “The 
American instinct that led these young men and women to pick up 
the torch and cross this bridge, that’s the same instinct that moved 
patriots to choose revolution over tyranny. It’s the same instinct that 
drew immigrants from across oceans and the Rio Grande; the same 
instinct that led women to reach for the ballot, workers to organize 
against an unjust status quo; the same instinct that led us to plant 
a flag at Iwo Jima and on the surface of the moon.” 

“He’s kind of a black Reagan,” says Anthea Butler. “He likes  
to believe in big, lofty things.” 

In his work, Gates has examined “the burden of representation,” 
which he once defined as “the homely notion that you represent 
your race, thus that your actions can betray your race or honor it.” 
It is why Obama is being asked repeatedly whether he’s done 
enough for black America. It is why Jarrett answers repeatedly that 
she is not sure why it’s his job. And it is why Anthea Butler ruefully 
responds, in turn: “Every black person has this job whether they 
want it or not—and he’s the president. History is going to think it’s 
his job. We’re going to talk about him for the next 500 years.”

But as Coleman points out, there is no consensus on how to do 
this job. “The enigma of President Obama on race,” he explains, 
“may be reflective of a larger question of how black Americans 
engage the conversation of race themselves. We are not a mono-
lithic group, as anyone with a brain can figure out.” To take some 
crude examples from public life: Jesse Jackson is not Colin Powell 
is not Ben Carson. “There are those of us who feel like we don’t have 
to make it always about race,” he says, “and then there are those for 
whom it’s the opposite: Race accounts for everything and anything.” 
Coleman then turns to the question of Obama. “The difficulty with 
the president is that I’m not sure I know where he stands.”

But this, of course, is what being human is: reconciling contra-
dictions in our muddled identities, containing multitudes. This, 
in fact, is what Obama is known for—he sees things on one hand 
and then on the other, he empathizes with all points of view. At its 
heart, Obama’s autobiography, Dreams From My Father, was 
about reckoning with the basic question of who he was. This sum-
mer, he revisited his adolescent confusion when speaking to Marc 
Maron. Noting that Maron’s studio wasn’t far from his old stomp-
ing grounds at Occidental College, the president mentioned that 
those years raised a lot of questions for him, like: “Who am I 
really? A lot of that revolved around issues of race.” He then elabo-
rated on those issues, channeling the inner dialogue of his younger 
self: “I am an African-American, but not grounded in a place with 
a lot of African-American culture”—Hawaii, he meant. “So I’m 
trying to figure out: All right, I’m seen and viewed and understood 
as a black man in America. What does that mean?”

Back in 2006, I interviewed Obama for this magazine. I asked 
him if he’d ever read Gates’s essay in The New Yorker about Colin 
Powell. He hadn’t, though he loved Gates’s work. I mentioned a 
critical distinction that Gates made: Jackson wanted to be the first 
black president. Powell, if he were to run, wanted to be the first 
president who happened to be black.

“I don’t think that those two are necessarily opposing,” Obama PH

told me. “I don’t want people to pretend I’m not black or that it’s 
somehow not relevant. But ultimately, I’d want to be a really great 
president, you know? And then I’d worry about all the other stuff. 
Because there are a lot of mediocre or poor presidents.”

To borrow a favorite phrase of the president’s, let me be clear: 
Obama is tremendously popular with African- Americans. Right 
now, his approval rate is 91 percent among them, and he’s rarely 
fallen below 80 percent. Even his critics in this story are still his 
supporters. Van Jones is his dogged defender on television. Jim 
Clyburn notes repeatedly that Obama rescued us during a recession, 
pulled us out of Iraq. Paul Butler, from Georgetown University Law 
Center, has an Obama action figure sitting on his kitchen table. 
Whenever he discovers it’s been knocked over, he makes a point of 
standing it back on its feet.

Anthea Butler notes that there’s a generation of black Americans 
who don’t just love the president but wish badly to protect him—not 
just psychologically but physically. “If you talk to an older black 
person,” she tells me, “somebody who’s 70 or older, they’re gonna be 
like, ‘Honestly, we just want him to get out alive.’ ”

Al Sharpton, one of Obama’s staunchest defenders and a some-
time adviser, argues that there is much to be grateful for in this 
presidency. “You know how many black people tell me, ‘I didn’t have 
health insurance until now’?” The Affordable Care Act is projected 
to give an estimated 2.9 million more  African-Americans coverage 
by 2016, significantly narrowing the coverage gap between blacks 
and whites. “It’s extremely strange to hear people question Presi-
dent Obama who never questioned Bill Clinton,” he continues. 
“Under Bill Clinton, we got the crime bill that gave us three strikes 
and you’re out, and the welfare-reform bill. I too would have liked 
to see the Obama years do more. I agree with that. But Barack 
Obama never gave us a bill that hurt us.”

Sharpton has gotten a lot of grief for his support of Obama. Cor-
nel West, whose manifold political objections to the president are 
at this point hard to separate from his personal ones, went so far as 
to call the reverend “the bona fide house Negro of the Barack Obama 
plantation.” But Sharpton says he’s come by his support for the 
president through some hard-won local lessons. “When I sat in New 
York with the first and only black mayor,” he tells me, referring to 
David Dinkins, “we tried to push him on various issues.” Dinkins 
kept trying to push back, saying he had to govern for all New York-
ers. It was the same defense as Obama’s. “So we started calling him 
names,” says Sharpton, “and we started saying, ‘You shoulda done 
this that and the other.’ ” He pauses. “And we ended up with 20 years 
of Rudy Giuliani and Michael Bloomberg.” 

Obama’s supporters can point to a number of his accomplish-
ments with regard to race. His attorney general Eric Holder rebuilt 
the civil-rights division within the DOJ; in 2013, Holder also 
announced the Smart on Crime initiative, which instructs federal 
prosecutors to avoid bringing charges that would trigger manda-

tory minimum penalties in the case of certain low-level crimes. 
Then there is the possibility of the criminal-justice-reform bill. “If 
he can sign a bipartisan bill by Christmas,” says Jones, “it’ll make 
up for the frustrations of the middle years.”

In February 2014, the White House started the My Brother’s 
Keeper initiative, a public-private effort that both partners with 
communities and helps nourish existing federal programs that 
boost the prospects of young men of color. (This summer, for 
instance, the new attorney general, Loretta Lynch, announced a 
pilot program that would give Pell grants to prisoners.) It won’t end 
when Obama leaves the White House. This May, Obama announced 
the formation of the My Brother’s Keeper Alliance, a nonprofit pow-
ered by an all-star advisory board (John Legend, Colin Powell, 
Shaq) and millions of corporate dollars that will attempt to close the 
opportunity gap for young men of color. 

“This will remain a mission for me and Michelle not just for the 
rest of my presidency,” he said when announcing the program, “but 
for the rest of my life.” How large a role it will play in Obama’s post-
presidential life has yet to be determined. But its conception is 
entirely consistent with the president’s ideals and modus operandi. 
It turns him into a community organizer again—but, this time, with 
millions of dollars and the Rolodex of a former president of the 
United States.

These accomplishments may not be as epic as some have 
wished. But even the presidency has its limitations. When Jarrett 
told the audience in Aspen that it isn’t Obama’s responsibility to 
change race relations in the United States, it may have seemed like 
a punt. He is, after all, the man with the electoral mandate, the 
bully pulpit, the veto pen, the executive order, and, for his first two 
years, the Democratic majority in both chambers of Congress. But 
her response also had the effect of lobbing the question right back 
to her mostly white audience. Because here’s how she followed up: 
“The question is: What are we gonna do? It’s a collective respon-
sibility. This is not something where suddenly, because the coun-
try elected him president, our history just evaporates. It has to 
happen family by family.”

The hardest part, for those who root for Obama, is that before 
long, these issues will no longer be his responsibility at all, at least 
as commander-in-chief. Sharpton believes African-Americans will 
sorely miss the simple image of a black family going in and out of 
the White House each day. Obama’s triumph, as far as he’s con-
cerned, was a mute, daily reminder of the possibility of black ascen-
dancy, an invisible psychological superstructure onto which a whole 
generation of black children could unconsciously graft their aspira-
tions. “When all the smoke clears and Barack Obama’s gone,” says 
Sharpton, “a white president will succeed a black president. We’ve 
never been here before. And what will that do emotionally and oth-
erwise in the black community that is already up in arms? When we 
don’t even have the symbolic charge of seeing a black man and 
woman, two girls, on the news every night?”

In the meantime, there is, to borrow another Obama trope, still 
possibility for change. “I think you’re going to see a lot of things 
happen in this last 15 months, and he’s going to go all out to address 
the problems he’s been reluctant to give extensive statements 
about,” says Elijah Cummings, who represents Baltimore and was 
head of the Congressional Black Caucus when Obama first ran for 
Senate. “I just do.” 

He tells a story about the night of Obama’s first inauguration. “I’ll 
never forget: My wife and I were at the White House with him, after 
he finished all the parties. And he said, ‘Elijah, I don’t know how 
much I’m going to be able to do. But I’m going to do everything in 
my power to make the world a better place for the community you’re 
in.’ ” Whatever disappointments there have been in the years since, 
he believes that is still Obama’s goal. “Sometimes,” says Cummings, 
“he’s just doing things quietly.”  ■

The Unprecedented

‘ C ITY ON FIRE,’ 
a debut novel,  

generated a  
headline-making  

$2 million bidding war. 
Which means  

quite a lot is riding  
on its 36-year-old  

author. Believe  
it or not, he’s chasing  
even bigger things.

By  B ORIS KACHKA

never wanted to be the 
guy wearing a T-shirt that 
read ask me about my 
novel,” says Garth Risk Hall-
berg. One August evening in 
2012, he was that guy. He’d 
been invited to the wedding of 
writer-banker Gary Sernovitz 
and academic Molly Pulda at 
the Bowery Hotel. Among his 

tablemates were Diana Miller, his future 
editor; Tom Bissell, whom he’d just reviewed 
in the Times; and Chris  Parris-Lamb,  
a young literary agent whose recent success 
with Chad Harbach’s The Art of Fielding was 
well known to all—including the writer 
seated across from him. A souvenir “diction-
ary” defined each guest. Hallberg’s entry 
read: “Critic- novelist certain he will win the 
Postmodernist Fiction Trivia Contest to be 
held in the men’s bathroom at 11:59 tonight.”

intricate dream of its opposite: dangerous, 
democratic ’70s New York. Secondhand 
nostalgia for that dark decade surely 
appealed to Parris-Lamb and the mostly 
young editors who bid up its price, the first 
generation to know New York only as a pad-
ded playground. It might also suit the tastes 
of readers primed by art shows, TV series, 
and essays besotted with the era. Packed 
with violence, arson, drugs, and corruption 
but also love, sex, punk rock, “found” art, 
and literal fireworks, City on Fire can look 
like an object machine-tooled for maxi-
mum market impact. But that would prob-
ably be unfair to the writer and even the 
publisher. Better to say that Hallberg made 
a very long and sincere novelistic case for 
grandeur, connectedness, and fiction itself 
in a fragmented, reality-hungry world, and 
the industry bought it.

Hallberg says he wrote City on Fire under 
the “necessary fiction” that no one would 
ever publish it—“a very useful position for 
me in doing whatever the fuck I wanted.”  
A few SAT words aside, the most obvious 
obstacle is its length; to look at a few recent 
very long best sellers and award winners, 
though, that might actually be an asset. It 
certainly telegraphs audacity. City on Fire 
was sold on comparisons to Donna Tartt’s 
The Goldfinch and Tom Wolfe’s The Bonfire 
of the Vanities, but its own vanities—its 
vocabulary, wingspan, and philosophical top 
notes—speak to Hallberg’s obsessions with 
Don DeLillo and David Foster Wallace and 
the great Victorian “triple- deckers.” Asked to 
explain its commercial appeal, Knopf’s reti-
cent editor-in-chief, Sonny Mehta, tapped 
an unlit cigarette and shifted uncomfortably 
behind his desk. “Well, look,” he said, “it’s the 
ambition of it.”

Ambition is a loaded word. You can be 
ambitious for artistic achievement or for 
fame, money, power, immortality. Hall-
berg is refreshingly direct about what he’s 
after. “My goal,” he says, “was to get the 
book somewhere that is going to allow me 
to be DeLillo 40 years from now.” Whether 
that goal is advanced by a $2 million book 
deal is an open question.

ho didn’t exist at 
the convergence of a 
thousand thousand 
stories?” asks City on 
Fire’s gnarled detec-
tive, contemplating 
the “ley-lines” that 

link its sundry players—a corporate 
dynasty, an anarchist collective, a misfit 
teen, a boozy New  Journalist—to a Central 
Park shooting on New Year’s Eve 1976. The 
novel is a 911-page mosaic in which punk 
lyrics clash with Latin, grime with glitz,  

a 25-page pasted-together zine with a 
medical report, a nihilistic terror plot with 
a naked plea for empathy. 

It’s also something of a page-turner, by 
virtue of its plot twists and its sheer accu-
mulation of stuff (see review on page 129). 
The novel amasses evidence concerning 
not just the mystery of who shot 17-year-
old Samantha Cicciaro but many other 
crimes both committed and foiled. Among 
them are the burning of the Bronx,  
a bombing in midtown, financial skul-
duggery, infidelity, and looting—more 
broadly, the piecemeal destruction of the 
city’s social fabric. Hallberg renders that 
chaos not as dystopia but its opposite, Bad 
Old New York as a city of dreamers—a pair 
of truant Long Island teens, a gay black 
Southerner, a wealthy heir hooked on punk 
and heroin—looking not for careers or 
ways to afford rent but for answers, con-
nections, and meaning. City on Fire’s big-
gest mystery is whether blackout-era New 
York is worth saving, and Hallberg’s 
answer seems to be: now more than ever.

Exactly 38 years after the blackout, this 
past July 13, Hallberg was wilting slightly 
in a sunbaked, manicured corner of Tomp-
kins Square Park, trying to define his style. 
“There’s a great description of the album 
Born to Run,” he said, then quoted Greil 
Marcus verbatim: “ ‘A ’57 Chevy running 
on melted down Crystals records.’ It’s one 
of my favorite albums, but it feels instantly 
recognizable, because it speaks the lan-
guage of Phil Spector and Duane Eddy and 
all the great one-hit wonders. And just 
supercolliding them … Spring steen was so 
obsessive about every note. You would 
never call that album experimental or 
avant-garde, but somehow in the context 
of Captain & Tennille or—uhm …” He 
paused as the disco strings of Michael 
Jackson’s “Don’t Stop ’Til You Get Enough” 
suddenly erupted nearby. “Yes, that!” 

The music was blaring from a speaker 
mounted on a passing bicycle. “I want that 
for my bike, that’s awesome,” he said,  
a toothy grin breaking his middle- distance 
stare. But it didn’t throw his conversation 
off course; not much can. “Hold that 
thought,” he’ll say to an interjected ques-
tion, just barely flashing impatience before 
rolling into his next paragraph. 

Hallberg is more adept than most at 
banishing distraction. He wakes up to 
work long before his family does and 
checks his email only at rare intervals. He 
still owns a tiny flip phone, and he guards 
his time, attention, and privacy by burrow-
ing into what one friend calls a “pre- 
connected universe.”

A charming, insistent monologuist, 
Hallberg strings together serial analogies. 

At the time, the “novelist” part was 
notional. Hallberg’s wife was the only one at 
the wedding who had seen the thousand-
page stack of text and graphics that would 
become City on Fire, a sprawling, populous 
mystery culminating in New York’s 1977 
blackout, for which Knopf would later pay 
$2 million—probably the highest North 
American advance ever for a debut novel. 
Hallberg had been thinking about it for 
nine years and quietly writing it for five. But 
at the wedding, he was just a gangly 
33-year-old blogger-critic with two kids 
and five figures of debt, a junior-varsity 
member of Table 14. 

Hallberg and Parris-Lamb were paired 
up, Pulda says, because they were “two tall 
skinny guys” from North Carolina. “He is 
from an even shittier town than I am,” says 
Parris-Lamb, “so we were doing the com-
petitive thing: ‘I made it further than you’ or 
‘I started lower than you.’ Which, of course, 
as white men we should never do, but you 
know what I mean.” Parris-Lamb was sleek 
and tailored, as always. Hallberg wore 
second hand off-white velvet pants. A few 
drinks later, Hallberg got up the nerve to 
pop the question, and before long they were 
“totally breaking it down on the dance floor.”

All meet-cute stories have at least two 
versions. Hallberg remembers asking,  
“So, what would you do with a thousand-
page manuscript?” To which Parris-Lamb 
replied, “Is it yours?” Parris-Lamb recalls a 
general question about agents. “I said, ‘Why 
don’t you just tell me about the book?’ He 
said, ‘Well, it may be unpublishably long.’ 
And I laughed and said something like, ‘Go 
big or go home.’ ”

Parris-Lamb sent it out the following 
autumn, and it went big. Of the 14 editors 
who read the manuscript, 12 wanted it. 
Seven houses (representing nine editors) 
bid more than $1 million at auction before 
Knopf won for twice that—more than three 
times what Harbach was paid. Scott Rudin 
optioned the film rights for six figures the 
day after getting the manuscript; 17 other 
countries have already bought it. Knopf has 
given away 6,500 advance copies, more 
than most first novels ever sell, and has 
scheduled an 18-city tour and an ad cam-
paign as tentacular, to use a Hallberg word, 
as the book itself. But while Knopf is front-
ing the cash, almost everyone in publishing 
is invested in its success (even those who 
work for Knopf ’s rivals and those who 
grumble about too many eggs in too few 
baskets). There are only so many $2 million 
bets any house can afford to lose. 

But why this novel, at this time? One of 
the ironies of Hallberg’s windfall is that he 
mastered a winner-takes-all system in a 
winner-takes-all city by selling a vivid and

He sees connections everywhere and 
wants you to see them, too. He talks with 
his long arms, waving dramatically to indi-
cate a far-off time or clawing at the air to 
pull home an idea. He has a born prosely-
tizer’s synthesis of earnest passion, perfect 
timing, cleverness, and self- deflation. 
“There’s almost no snark in him, no sar-
casm,” a friend told me. “He’s smart, self-
possessed, confident, and not impressed 
with himself,” Rudin said. When I said that 
sounded almost like an oxymoron, he said, 
“That’s what I mean.”

Hallberg was born outside Baton Rouge 
and grew up in Greenville, North Carolina. 
His parents had met as students in Ohio, 
his dad an M.F.A. candidate and his 
mother an English-major undergrad. After 
his father found a tenure-track position at 
East Carolina University, his mother—“in 
certain ways the brains of the operation”—
was sidelined into teaching high school. 
Hallberg hesitates to speak ill of Greenville, 
but he was clearly out of place. “It’s a little 
like Friday Night Lights,” he says over waf-

fles on the Lower East Side. “I felt like a 
total freak in a lot of ways.” Home was 
uncomfortable “in a totally different way.” 
His parents divorced when he was 13. 
“There was a lot of complicated stuff going 
on, and the byword was to pretend that it 
wasn’t, and I was probably a more than 
ordinarily observant child. You don’t end 
up in this job without having an unusual 
interest in observing people.”

When Garth was 9, his father, Bill, pub-
lished The Rub of the Green, a novel in the 
mode of Richard Ford about a pro golfer 
imprisoned in the aftermath of a love tri-
angle. Walker Percy blurbed it and, accord-
ing to Bill (who “was not always reliable”), it 
was optioned for the movies. “He was a per-
son with a lot of very complicated, persistent 
feelings about himself,” says Garth, “and he 
really thought this book was going to cover 
him in glory and that he had reached the  
top of the mountain and it was all smooth 
sailing from there. This wasn’t like a com-
mercial thing—it was like a Kafkaesque 
dream landscape, in which, for example,  

he was gonna say, ‘Mom, 
Dad, look, I finally made 
something of myself.’ ” 
The book has since gone 
out of print, and Bill 
never published another 
novel. “The discovery for 

him that there is no mountaintop was kind 
of devastating, and he had a really hard time 
doing the next book.”

Hallberg “stuck out in a lot of ways scho-
lastically.” As a preteen he gorged on mys-
teries—and brought a deerstalker hat to a 
book club where he was the youngest mem-
ber “by four decades”—before graduating, 
in high school, to the Beats and avant-garde 
poets (and berets). He says he was “the resi-
dent beatnik of North Carolina”—perhaps 
reacting to his mother’s specialty in Victo-
rian writers. Then came punk, via Patti 
Smith and the local record store. “I was like, 
‘I don’t want to be at home, so I might as 
well go through the vinyl,’ ” he says. He 
taught himself Rolling Stones riffs on his 
father’s girlfriend’s guitar. “And various

other things had happened,” he says 
vaguely. “I was kind of a disaster … I some-
how managed to elude getting arrested.” 
Whatever was going on, the real drama 
seemed to be happening elsewhere, in the 
cities that produced the art he loved—espe-
cially New York, where, in his own fantasti-
cal version of it, “James Baldwin and E. B. 
White and Patti Smith and Robert 
Rauschenberg could have passed each 
other on a street corner.”

The summer he was 16, his mother 
packed him off to a weeklong writing pro-
gram at Duke, and Hallberg’s life changed 
instantly. He felt he had finally found his 
people, misfit nerds channeling their rebel-
lion into work. “I remember them as having 
this incredibly pure golden light of whole-
someness beaming through their pores,” he 
says. “It was okay to care about stuff—it was 
a socially normed thing.” His fastest friend 
was Derek Teslik, who attended St. Albans, 
the Washington prep school that was at the 
center of D.C.’s latter-day hardcore scene. 
(Nineties post-punk worked in mysterious 
ways.) Fugazi was still gigging; Jonathan 
Fire*Eater, the band most likely to succeed 
them, had recently left for New York, where 
they’d become what the New York Observer 
called “one of the fastest rise-and-fall sto-
ries in recent pop music.” 

The following year, his Fridays having 
been freed up for “independent study,” Hall-
berg would wake up at 4:30—“my writing 
time now”—and make the four-hour drive 
to the nation’s capital. “Here I have my little 
life in Tobacco Road, where I’m losing my 
shit mentally,” says Hallberg, “but D.C. was 
kind of the first real metropolis for me. 
There were all these friends and internecine 
tensions, and they were like, ‘Who is this 
beatnik road warrior?’ ” He may have seen 
himself that way, but to those new friends 
he likely came across as an easygoing shape-
shifter, comfortable in many skins. “He 
could seamlessly flow from world to world,” 
says Walker Lambert, a St. Albans alum 
who was the best man at Hallberg’s wed-
ding. “From a punk scene to a cocktail party 
at a nice house to a football game, he could 
merge into almost any scene and not seem 
like a complete outsider.”

Hallberg’s prose still has that impersonat-
ing impulse—what he calls “a Dickensian 
thing, the ragpicker.” His osmotic travels 
didn’t stop in D.C. His first visit to New York 

inspired him to write a Frank O’Hara–style 
poem cycle. “I had one week in the fall of 
1996,” he says, “where I was like, ‘I’m Amer-
ica’s greatest living teenage poet.’ ” To natives, 
New York was becoming safe, denatured, 
but to the young writer and his friends, it 
still felt feral. Ostensibly visiting colleges, 
they would decamp at the Port Authority, 
“and the first thing you would see would be 
Peep land.” Nursing cans of Foster’s, they 
would bar- and park-hop from Columbia to 
the Village. Their more colorful anecdotes 
worked their way into City on Fire. So did 
pieces of Teslik’s ’90s zine, Helter Skelter 
(giving the novel’s version an oddly indie-
rock vibe). So did a defiantly timeless sense 
of possibility. “There’s like an internet thing: 
This,” says Hallberg. “What is it—a meme or 
a hashtag? That was New York for me when 
I got off the bus. This. THIS!”

City on Fire is a gossamer-veiled homage 
to September 11—an event Hallberg only 
saw from a television set in D.C.’s Watergate 
complex. While studying on scholarship at 
Washington University in St. Louis, he met 
Elise White, now his wife, and after gradua-
tion they moved to the capital while she pur-
sued an American-studies Ph.D. and he 
marked time at an internet trade-digest 
operation. Visiting New York after 9/11, he 
says, he bore witness to that feeling of sus-
pension we’ve since heard so much about, 
even as it feels less and less real to those who 
were there: “That sense of people living 
closer to the surface of their skin and feeling 
like they’re in the middle of a change and 
they weren’t sure how it was gonna work 
out. This is really what the prologue of the 
book deals with.” That prologue ends with  
a Whitmanesque appeal to New York 
dreamers of every era. “Who doesn’t still 
dream of a world other than this one?” asks 
an unknown narrator. “Who among us—if 
it means letting go of the insanity, the mys-
tery, the totally useless beauty of the million 
once-possible New Yorks—is ready even 
now to give up hope?”

In 2003, Hallberg was taking a Grey-
hound into New York, his first daylight bus 
visit since his college days. On the looping 
Jersey-side approach to the Lincoln Tunnel, 
his iPod turned up Billy Joel’s “Miami 2017 
(Seen the Lights Go Out on Broadway),” an 
apocalyptic dirge written not long before the 
blackout that describes the abandonment 
and sinking of Manhattan. “It’s Joel at his 

most florid,” says Hallberg, laughing. But 
just then, the city’s skyline slid into view, as 
it always had—only this time, without those 
two towers. He’s told this story before, both 
a straightforward origin story and a pre-
emptive testament to his own sincerity. “It’s 
just sort of apotheotic,” Hallberg says. “The 
whole book more or less came to me in that 
moment. Henry James says something like, 
‘A sense of possession takes hold.’ ” He went 
directly to Union Square Park and wrote one 
long scene in his notebook. Then he stopped. 
I don’t have the chops to write this, he 
thought. I don’t even live here.

fter our first meet-
ing, Hallberg emailed 
me a short essay he 
wrote on a slack day  
at his internet job.  
He introduced it by 
explaining, “I was 22 
or 23, trying to record 
and understand a felt 

phenomenon. And perhaps this falls under 
the heading of personal mythology … but  
I now feel a high degree of dramatic irony 
here.” The essay is about a feeling he’d had 
since age 6—“this sudden sense of remem-
bering” things that had never happened to 
him. It begins, “I wonder, is nostalgia the 
right word if you never in the first place lived 
the thing you’re missing?”

The year after the Billy Joel epiphany, 
Hallberg won a fellowship to earn an 
M.F.A. at NYU, where he studied with the 
novelist Brian Morton. “He had a kind of 
ceaseless interest in trying new things,” 
says Morton, and his short stories bear 
that out. One is structured as a final exam. 
Another is a filibuster delivered by  
a would-be school shooter. There’s a “love 
song” composed of (mostly fabricated) 
quotes from former Bush press secretary 
Ari Fleischer, dialogue in a Russian accent, 
and a piece with subtitles named after 
Smiths songs. Hallberg’s 2007 novella  
A Field Guide to the North American Fam-
ily tracks suburbanites coming of age in 
cross-referenced dictionary entries. Most 
of these experiments are sorcerer’s-
apprentice work, magic slightly beyond his 
control. But they point to a writer collect-
ing and absorbing artifacts, Born to Run 
style, and making them his own. “Some 
writers would write four different kinds of 

“ My goal was to get the book somewhere that is going  
to allow me to be DeLillo 40 years from now.”

family stories, but you could easily tell 
which family they grew up in,” says Mor-
ton. “He had the ability to get into the 
experience of widely different characters in 
a way that felt very authentic.”

Morton lived through the blackout. He 
believes City on Fire “nailed it,” but he also 
found it “more traditional than I would 
have expected.” Hallberg’s turn toward 
social realism must have been self- 
conscious, coinciding as it did with his work 
as a critic pondering the future of the novel. 
Though he considers his reviewing career—
mostly for the website the Millions—“very, 
very accidental,” his reputation quickly sur-
passed that of a typical blogger; he has twice 
been a finalist for the National Book Critics 
Circle’s critic award. A couple of his stron-
gest pieces take other critics to task for mak-
ing work sound more experimental than it 
is: James Wood overplaying the postmoder-
nity of DeLillo’s Underworld, Zadie Smith 
overplaying the avant-gardeness of Tom 
McCarthy’s Remainder.

Hallberg never wrote a grand argument 
for the wide-lens social novel, as Wolfe and 
Jonathan Franzen have, but he takes the 
attention paid to City on Fire as evidence 
that “this battery is not devoid of juice.” Its 
supposed demise had less to do with 
demand or supply, he’d always suspected, 
than with publishing itself. “I assumed that 

whatever mechanisms had existed for con-
veying this sort of book into the world had 
stopped doing so,” he says. His defenses of 
the readability of Underworld and Infinite 
Jest are calls to enlarge our idea of the main-
stream. But he never seemed to doubt that 
his own book, if published, would find that 
mainstream on its own. “I think it is confi-
dent of being read,” he says. “There’s just 
something about it that strikes me as assum-
ing that its audience exists. That’s the demo-
cratic thing. Underworld has that.”

There’s also something new that Hall-
berg wants to do with City on Fire. In 2012, 
he wrote an essay for the Times Magazine 
on the Franzen-Eugenides-Wallace cohort 
headlined “Why Write Novels at All?” He 
read into their generation a desire to make 
readers feel less lonely by showing them 
other lonely people. Hallberg wanted to 
turn that notion on its head. “Think about 
it,” he wrote. “I can love you because I want 
to feel less alone, or I can love you because  
I want you to feel less alone.” His elders, he 
concluded, fell short on that second kind of 

love—empathy rather 
than self- consolation. 
What he didn’t quite say 
in the piece seems obvi-
ous now: This is where 
his kind of novel comes 
in. By entering the con-

sciousness of so many characters and build-
ing connections between them (“I see you. 
You are not alone,” read the last lines of City 
on Fire), he wants to teach readers empa-
thy—to make us better people. 

hallberg describes his novel-writing 
process in the manner of an ecstatic math-
ematician. Working on graph paper 
(“there’s something pleasurable about fill-
ing the boxes”), he spent roughly six months 
on the first of the seven parts, typed it up, 
wrote the next one, typed up the two parts 
together, and so on. “I had never been as 
excited about a piece of writing,” he says.  
“I felt like Spider-Man, swinging through 
the city, throwing out a web and not know-
ing where it was going to hit. And it hits the 
next thing and you’re like—perfect.”

The working title in the box Hallberg 
delivered to Parris-Lamb was an abbrevi-
ated quote from E. B. White’s Here Is New 
York: “This city, which not to look upon 
would be like death.” Parris-Lamb wasn’t 
bowled over by the title—or the graphic 
elements or the length, especially—but the 
book grew and grew on him. He was 
unconvinced by a large plot point that “felt 
like it came from a different novel.” Hall-
berg also queried two very established 
agents and held off Parris-Lamb for 
months. He won’t say what the agent’s spe-

cific reservations were, but he eventually 
came back to Parris-Lamb with a solution. 
He wound up cutting not just the plot 
point but an entire character.

Parris-Lamb’s pitch letter to the 14 pub-
lishers called City on Fire “a complex, 
utterly relevant social novel that can stand 
toe to toe with the best of the genre.” A day 
after sending it, he got his first offer—from 
a producer. “I loved it,” Scott Rudin told me. 
“It’s a wonderful idea, and it’s got this great 
high-low thing going on at the center of it.” 
Rudin turned 19 the day the lights went out 
and he had to walk home from the Public 
Theater to the Upper West Side. “For years 
I’ve thought, Is there a blackout movie?” 

When Parris-Lamb told Hallberg he was 
passing on a $1 million preempt offer from 
Atavist Books, Hallberg hesitated. Would 
they definitely get back up to that level? But 
he also told Parris-Lamb: “I didn’t need $1 
million. I needed $50,000”—enough to pay 
off student loans and credit-card bills and 
maybe change apartments. It wasn’t just 
confidence that had made him ready to 
share City on Fire by the time of Sernovitz’s 
wedding. Since he’d started the book, he 
and White had had two sons, forcing a 
move deeper into Brooklyn. Morton had 
helped him get a few teaching jobs, but 
those and “pouring coffee” weren’t enough. 
“At this point, I’m trapping mice in the 
morning so that my wife doesn’t have to 
deal with them,” he says, “and she’s working 
on her dissertation and I’m thinking, I’d bet-
ter send this out, because something’s got to 
change or we’re gonna leave the city.” So 
what’s changed so far? “Aside from my 
Bentley and my six swimming pools,” says 
Hallberg, “I’m still the same guy.” But seri-
ously: “I know what my hourly rate was,” he 
says, having amortized the amount over 
seven years of writing. “It’s not the astro-
nomical thing that it would appear to be, 
but it ain’t minimum wage. The city was 
gonna eat us alive, and this saved us.”

Hallberg’s decision, in 2007, to stake his 
family’s future on the biggest idea he’d ever 
had was catalyzed by a crisis in the family 
he’d left behind. That year, his father was 
diagnosed with cancer. “My dad got sick, 
and it activated or entangled itself with a lot 
of other things that were going on in my life 
and in the life of other people who cared 
about my dad.” He won’t say much more, 

except that he photocopied a 20-page sec-
tion of Infinite Jest—a list of “lessons” from 
a halfway house—and sent them to another 
family member “in dire straits.”

Six years later, as Hallberg made the 
rounds of one fawning publisher after 
another, his father was recovering from sur-
gery; he’d given up on chemotherapy. “And 
all of this whatever,” says Hallberg, “which  
I could do without—that was his dream.  
It was a dream come true, but it was some-
body else’s dream.” Bill Hallberg died in 
May 2014, while Garth was deep into the 
editing process. “In a way, for it to remain 
purely theoretical so that he could imagine 
some world-bestriding thing was beautiful, 
because in actuality it’s going to be all kinds 
of mixed shit, and there is no mountaintop, 
and my job is to write the next thing.”

’m going to allow myself 
exactly two beers,” Hallberg says 
at our final meeting, dinner in 
the backyard of Park Slope’s 
faux-rustic Flatbush Farm. 
Having initially banned on-the-
record alcohol, he’s changed his 

mind. His rules of press engagement are 
still in flux. “I’m just a very deliberate—as 
you’ve probably picked up on—person in 
a lot of ways.” 

Like many younger writers, Hallberg 
longs for an older model of author celeb-
rity. One of his reviews describes the ten-
sion between market pressures and dreams 
of immortality: “On the supply side, pub-
lishers rush to promote ‘instant classics’ 
before posterity can render a verdict. On 
the demand side, we feel grateful for the 
distraction of ‘a good read.’ ” When he talks 
of envying DeLillo, it isn’t just his longevity 
or reputation. “If it were 30 years ago, you 
could still do a full DeLillo” and decline 
most publicity, “and that in itself wouldn’t 
be a calculated presentation,” he says. 
“Now all of your options are sub culture 
versus commercial publishing. Everything 
has already been subsumed into a panoply 
of brand positions.” Twice, he tells me, 
while commuting from Sarah Lawrence, 
he saw DeLillo on the train, but decided 
against introducing himself. “He’s given 
me so much, but whatever he has to give 
here isn’t that—and it’s just gonna make 
him uncomfortable.” 

Hallberg has already ridden the highs and 
lows of promotion. He attended the big 
trade fair BookExpo America and manned 
a busy signing booth. “There’s probably an 
element of the Most Photographed Barn in 
America,” Hallberg says, referring to the tau-
tologically popular attraction in DeLillo’s 
White Noise. “People don’t know who the 
fuck you are, but they’ve been told everyone 
wants it.” Over and over again, strangers 
who knew nothing about the book except 
for its buzz asked him: How does it feel?  
“It seemed like this Zen thing mixed with a 
D’Angelo song,” he says. “How does it feel? 
How does it feel? How does it feel?”

It feels weird. Advance reviews on Ama-
zon and Goodreads have been mixed; many 
of them bring up the hype and the money. 
To Derek Teslik, the noise and the backlash 
feel familiar: “The echo that I have is Jona-
than Fire*Eater, this band we all knew 
growing up was the next big thing. Dream-
Works won the bidding war, and it was 
huge. And then everyone realized they were 
just a band—a good band, but not the savior 
of the music industry.” After they broke up, 
some of the band’s members later reformed 
as the Walkmen—one of whose members 
will debut a new song in a City on Fire 
trailer. As for Hallberg, says Teslik, “I think 
he can handle it.”

I heard this consistently from friends: 
Garth can handle it. “This is the rap that  
I give to my students,” Hallberg says. “It’s 
you and Virginia Woolf, man. And in all 
likelihood you won’t be that great, but you 
will have gotten to dance with the very best. 
It may be that Tolstoy and Virginia Woolf 
were sitting around fretting about their 
Amazon reviews or their pre-pub whatever, 
but I kind of doubt it. I don’t think that’s 
how the work probably got made.”

Not to say that worldly fame is never on 
his mind. “I saw this great documentary,” he 
says—part two of The Decline of Western 
Civilization, Penelope Spheeris’s trilogy on 
the rock life. “Gene Simmons gives this 
interview from this lingerie store and he 
says, Anyone who tells you it’s lonely at the 
top, don’t buy it. And then Dave Mustaine 
from Megadeth says, Anyone who wants to 
become a rock star, don’t. And between 
those two poles lies the truth. But you know, 
there’s always a Gene Simmons in my head. 
Good fortune is good fortune.” ■

“ I felt like Spider-Man, swinging through  
the city, throwing out a web and not knowing  
where it was going to hit.”

Reddit failed to mature and was repeat-
edly wracked by disruptive forces. Reddit 
is, above all, a collection of nearly 10,000 
bulletin boards called sub-Reddits, which 
range from the general, like Politics and 
Technology and Food, to the more particu-
lar, like one called Whalebait, where people 
post snapshots of everyone’s favorite ceta-
cean. Users can vote posts up or down, and 
through crowd curation the most favored 
items ascend to Reddit’s front page. In this 
way, the site has become the web’s foremost 
meme engine, the place where things go 
viral, and with 200 million regular visitors, 
it is able to unblushingly call itself “the front 
page of the internet.”

But more than other user-generated 
sites, such as YouTube and Wikipedia, 
Reddit over the years has developed a cul-
ture that can at times be untamable. It is 
one that venerates anonymity and free 
speech and the idea that you can find your 
tribe, however small and marginalized, 
within the site, and it is reflected in the 
company’s power structure: The number 
of people the site employs is dwarfed by 
the horde of moderators who voluntarily 
tend to the individual sub-Reddits and 
make the whole thing run.

The Reddit mob has been responsible 
for charming acts of mass whimsy (there’s 
a sub-Reddit for Redditors to send pizzas 
to each other, unbidden) and semi- regular 
demonstrations of the uplifting powers of 
a beneficently mobilized crowd (more 
than 200,000 people took part in last 
year’s Secret Santa gift exchange). It has 
also accommodated some of the most odi-

ous content on the internet, including the 
sub-Reddits Jailbait, Pics of Dead Kids, 
Fat People Hate, Beating Women, Gas the 
Kikes, Trans Fags, and Watch Niggers 
Die—all of which Reddit eventually 
banned, but only after much fretting over 
whether doing so would compromise the 
site’s ethics and drive away its users.

Over the years, whenever crises around 
controversial sub-Reddits would make 
the news, Huffman mostly empathized 
with his successors at the company: Deal-
ing with toxic content was a nettlesome 
issue, and he was glad he wasn’t the one 
who had to figure out how to do it. Plus he 
was busy with his new company, Hip-
munk, an airfare- comparison site. But 
Huffman’s perspective shifted over the 
July 4 weekend, after he learned that a 
Reddit employee named Victoria Taylor 
had been fired.

Taylor had a critical role at the com-
pany: She ran the popular Ask Me Any-

thing sub-Reddit, wherein a vacuum-
cleaner salesman or, say, the president of 
the United States fields questions from 
Redditors. She was also seen by her mod-
erator colleagues as one of the only people 
at headquarters who understood just how 
desperately moderators needed better 
tools to keep the site running smoothly in 
the face of increasingly provocative fac-
tions within the ever-larger community. 
Though it now appears Taylor was dis-
missed because she was resistant to  
innovations like adding videos to the 
AMAs (Taylor didn’t respond to interview 
requests), she was fired with no public 
explanation, and her sudden dismissal 
brought moderators’ simmering griev-
ances to a boil. In an event that would 
come to be called AMAgeddon, a rolling 
blackout began, and by Friday night, mod-
erators had shut off the lights in hundreds 
of the most popular sub-Reddits in pro-
test. News spread to Huffman. “Seriously, 
like 50 people texted me and said you 
need to go back to Reddit,” he says. The 
next day, he was up in Sonoma for a 
friend’s 30th-birthday party, and “a lot of 
the conversation was, ‘What the hell is 
going on at Reddit right now?’ ”

Huffman had always thought he’d come 
back eventually. After then-CEO Yishan 
Wong left Reddit in late 2014, Ohanian 
had returned as executive chairman, and 
since then, he’d repeatedly asked his old 
friend to join him as CEO. Huffman had 
always declined, citing Hipmunk, but now 
he found himself scared for Reddit’s future. 
An insurrection was under way. “I felt like, 
This is getting out of control, I think it is 
reparable, but I need to do something now,” 
Huffman says. “That’s when I finally called 
and said, ‘Fine, I’ll do it.’ ” It was Sunday, 
and the first person he could reach by 
phone was board member Sam Altman.

Of course, Reddit already had a CEO at 
the time: Ellen Pao, who had stepped in 
as interim leader after Wong’s departure 
and who had previously worked at the 
venture-capital firm Kleiner Perkins. 
While at Reddit, Pao was in the news for 
having filed a gender-discrimination suit 
against Kleiner; though the jury ruled 
against her, her suit had brought  attention 
to the challenges women face in Silicon 
Valley, and Pao’s experience over the next 
few days would play out as a nightmare 
version of some of those same issues. 
There was a feeling within Reddit that 
she wasn’t of Reddit—that it wasn’t a site 
she would choose to spend a lot of time 
on if it weren’t her job and that she failed 
to grasp the importance of managing its 
relationship with moderators. She 
became an easy scapegoat for the pre-

“Don’t sell too early”

his audience at  
a commencement 
speech last year.

teve huffman was on 
his couch when Reddit 
mutinied. Huffman had 
co-founded the popular 
news-ranking site with 
Alexis Ohanian in 2005 
and left in 2009 after 

selling it to Condé Nast. In the years since, he had watched from 
afar with a mix of pride, as the site grew into the 11th largest  
in the U.S.; remorse, for selling too early; and frustration, as

dominantly young and male Redditors, 
who, very maturely, had taken to calling 
her Chairman Pao. A Change.org petition 
for her to resign quickly gained more than 
200,000 signatures. 

On Monday, July 6, Pao apologized for 
Reddit’s negligent handling of moderators, 
but by then Huffman was waiting in the 
wings. Altman announced her departure 
that Friday while simultaneously announc-
ing Huffman’s return. The next week,  
Ohanian acknowledged that the decision 
to fire Taylor had been his, calling the com-
pany’s general insensitivity to moderators’ 
needs “a big screwup,” which he took “a ton 
of responsibility for.” In a good-bye post on 
Reddit, Pao wrote that she had “seen the 
good, the bad and the ugly” among Reddi-
tors and that “the ugly made me doubt 
humanity.”

The bile thrown at Pao unnerved every-
one. “She did some things I don’t think 
were particularly good decisions,” Altman 
says, “but CEOs make bad decisions, and 
I don’t think the community would have 
treated her as it did if she were a man.” 
Wong took to Reddit to suggest a theory 
that Pao’s exit was the penultimate falling 
domino in a long con by Reddit’s founders, 
who had orchestrated a series of events with 
the ultimate goal of prying the site out of 
Condé Nast’s control.

If the story line was short on evidence 
and possibly paranoid, it nonetheless 
tracked Huffman’s psychic trajectory: The 
pure-hearted founder had come home to 
save his wayward corporate child. “It’s 
kind of an egotistical thought,” Huffman 
says, “but I felt like I’m literally the only 
person in the world who can fix this and  
I had a moral obligation to do so.” 

s he says this, we are sit-
ting in a conference room 
at Reddit’s San Francisco 
headquarters, late on a 
Wednesday afternoon. Huff-

man has been back for only a month  
and is wearing the non-messianic uniform 
of a geek plutocrat: jeans, T-shirt, V-neck 
sweater, box-fresh red-striped Adidas, 
Pebble watch.

In San Francisco, Huffman has a close 
group of friends, drawn mainly from Y 
Combinator circles and including founders 
of Scribd and Twitch, with whom he rides 
motorcycles, belongs to a book club, takes 
swing-dancing lessons, and travels. This 
summer, that meant flying to Spain for a 
Twitch co-founder’s bachelor party, where, 
according to another Twitch co-founder, 
Justin Kan, “he was dominating Ibiza’s 
dance floor. He knows how to move that 
body.” In August, Huffman attended his

restrictions on its most vile sub-Reddits, using 

somewhat arbitrary distinctions. A sampling.

fourth Burning Man, staying in Kan’s camp 
Bao Chicka Wow Wow and helping to con-
struct a gigantic iceberg-shaped art car 
called Titanic’s End. “Steve helped a lot with 
building it,” Kan says. “He’s pretty handy.”

Kan calls Huffman the most talented 
programmer he’s known as well as the 
Reddit community personified. “Steve is 
the Ur-Redditor, the alpha Redditor. He’s 
very socially liberal. He has a strong liber-
tarian streak. And he’s a total troll on the 
internet. He’s the reason all of our friends 
have lock screens on our iPhones. Because 
if you left your iPhone out, he’d find your 
girlfriend or someone else important and 
figure out something to text them that 
would cause you a lot of grief. When I use 
Reddit, I see Steve in it.”

Huffman first met Ohanian at the Uni-
versity of Virginia, where they were fresh-
man-year hallmates and bonded over 
games of Gran Turismo 2 on Huffman’s 
PlayStation. They lived together for the 
next four years, during which Huffman 
regularly pranked Ohanian. Once, he 
hacked Ohanian’s political website, eyes-
wide.org (Huffman: “It took itself way too 
seriously”), so that outgoing emails would 
appear to come from a prom-dress web-
site. Shortly after graduating in 2005, 
they joined the first class of Y Combinator 
after brainstorming the idea for Reddit 
with the start-up incubator’s founder, 
Paul Graham. An executive there, charmed 
by their boyish enthusiasm, called them 
“the muffins.”

Reddit was an unexpected hit: Only 16 
months after they founded it, Huffman 
and Ohanian sold the site to Condé Nast 
for a reported $20 million, though a friend 
of Huffman’s says it was closer to $13 mil-
lion. “At the time, we felt, Oh, we’re in over 
our heads, the economy’s starting to tank, 
we’re a little dysfunctional  internally,  
so let’s take the money while we can,” Huff-
man says. “We thought we were failing. Our 
traffic was doubling every couple months. 
We’re like, Oh, gosh, how long’s this going 
to last?”

Indefinitely, as it turned out. But even 
as Reddit continued its rapid expansion, 
Condé Nast, which had bought the site as 
part of an effort to grow its digital side, 
was retrenching in the face of the financial 
crisis. It never gave Reddit the resources it 
needed to keep pace with exploding traf-
fic. Huffman and Ohanian stuck around 
for another three years before leaving. 
Huffman felt burned out, tired of waking 
up to 1,000 emails from angry Redditors 
in his in-box, tired of having just six 
employees, tired of having to constantly 
monitor the site even while on vacation, 
tired of internal dysfunction.

In recent years, Ohanian, who is six-five 
and can sell from the stage, has become the 
public face of Reddit, and Huffman’s con-
tribution has been occluded, but it was 
Huffman who coded the site. “We used to 
joke about that,” Huffman says. “I built 
Reddit, and Alexis made Reddit cool.” 
 Perhaps because of their friendship, they 
never precisely defined their roles. There 
was a long period when Ohanian was 
absent from the company so he could tend 
to his dying mother, and upon his return, 
Huffman was clearly the leader. “If you’d 
asked us who was in charge, and you had 
asked the employees of Reddit who was in 
charge, you’d have gotten different answers,” 
Huffman says. Ohanian says he was sur-
prised to find employees reporting to Huff-
man, “which made total sense but which  
I was too immature to realize.”

Becoming business partners had taken a 
toll on their friendship. “You start a com-
pany with your best friend, there’s always 
going to be a weird dynamic,” Ohanian says. 
“The ability to disassociate business conflict 
and discussion from personal conflict and 
discussion, ten years ago, was very hard.” At 
Reddit, Ohanian had been the nontechnical 
odd man out, surrounded by programmers 
who didn’t always understand the impor-
tance of, say, schwag. One time, according to 
Chris Slowe, Reddit’s first employee and 
now Hipmunk’s chief scientist, “we’re still 
treading water, and Alexis wanted to make 
plushies or action figures, and the two of 
them had a huge argument over, ‘You’re 
going to waste money on action figures?’ ”

Ohanian served as Huffman’s best man at 
his 2009 wedding to a med student (they 
would later divorce), and together they 
invested in the Broadway musical Billy 

Elliot. But the friends grew apart. Ohanian 
moved back to New York, where he devel-
oped his brand as an evangelist not just for 
Reddit but for online freedoms more gener-
ally. (Forbes crowned him “the Mayor of the 
Internet.”) Huffman got his pilot’s license, 
bought a 1995 Porsche, and spent the next 
several years building Hipmunk with co-
founder Adam Goldstein and a handful of 
fellow ex- Redditors who shared their rage 
over existing travel websites.

Hipmunk brought a wry sensibility to 
the increasingly widgetized travel busi-
ness (it rates flights on an “agony” index, a 
term that came from Huffman). It’s done 
pretty well—last year, Hipmunk secured a 
$20 million third round of venture-capital 
funding, and the site now employs around 
the same number of people as Reddit—
but it never held Huffman’s complete 
attention like Reddit did.

After leaving, Huffman found that he 
had a hard time letting go. He still had 
administrative access to the site and contin-
ued tinkering with its code. Once that 
access was cut off, he found a back door for 
another six months before finally being 
locked out. Even then, he remained an avid 
Reddit user, averaging an hour a day on the 
site and frequenting sub-Reddits like 
AskReddit and circlejerk (devoted to Red-
dit’s most popular inside jokes). Besides 
ruing the decision to sell the company 
(“Obviously”)—last year,  giving the com-
mencement speech at the Wakefield School, 
where he’d been senior-class president, his 
advice included “Don’t sell too early”—he 
could see from the sidelines that the site just 
wasn’t evolving fast enough. “I said that 
many times: ‘What is going on over there? 
Get to work, get to work, hire, hire.’ ”

Recently, Huffman started thinking 
about his unresolved relationship baggage 
with Ohanian, which he describes as “a lot 
of wounds we never dealt with from the 
past.” He brought it up with his therapist. 
“I was talking to him about how I miss hav-
ing Alexis in my life,” Huffman says. This 
past spring, he and Ohanian, over a few 
conversations involving steak and beers, 
“healed those things remarkably fast, in a 
matter of weeks.” 

n huffman’s first day back 
at Reddit, he introduced 
himself to the community by 
doing an Ask Me Anything: 
“I am Steve Huffman, the 

new CEO of Reddit. AMA.” To the quintes-
sential Reddit  question about whom he’d 
rather fight, 1,000 duck-size horses or one 
horse-size duck, Spez (Huffman’s Reddit 
pseudonym) responded: “1,000 duck-sized 
horses. Since they can’t climb stairs, you 
can easily get away from them long enough 
to figure out how to drown them.”

Many of the AMA questions concerned 
how Huffman would deal with objection-
able sub-Reddits. The company had never 
really settled on a way to handle them. In 
the site’s early days, the leadership had 
been paternalistic: “If we saw something 
terribly racist, we just removed it and no 
one cared,” recalls Jeremy Edberg, an early 
Reddit engineer who’s now at Netflix. That 
became more difficult once the site allowed 
users to start their own sub- Reddits. In 
2011, Condé Nast spun off Reddit into an 
independent holding of its parent com-
pany, Advance, and the next year Wong 
was hired as CEO. He took a hands-off 
approach and focused on growing the 
company. (Late last year, Reddit raised 
$50 million, at a valuation of $500 mil-
lion.) Then he left because Reddit’s board 
refused to move the offices closer to his 
home. When Pao took his place, she tried 
to shift to a policy distinguishing overt 
harassment from simple vileness. But at 
the same time, Ohanian was defending 
Reddit as “a bastion of free speech on the 
World Wide Web,” and whenever a sub-
Reddit received even a threat of banish-
ment, a great hue and cry would arise 
among Reddit’s most vocal power-users. It 
took a toll on staff morale and also made 
recruiting harder. Who would want to 
work at a company taken hostage by its 
most repugnant users?

Chris Slowe likens Huffman’s return to 
Reddit to Steve Jobs’s return to Apple. The 
 analogy is grandiose, but Slowe points 
out that the original departure of Reddit’s 
founders had left the site without an 
institutional grasp of the ad hoc reasons

many policies had been created. “Things 
that should be treated as case law started 
getting turned into the Constitution,” 
Slowe says. It was Huffman, and maybe 
only Huffman, who could divorce the site 
from its worst elements. “The Reddit job 
comes with a lot of baggage,” Huffman 
says, “but I think it’s easier for me, because 
I’m a founder, to say, ‘Screw you guys, this 
is how I’ve always wanted it to be.’ ” He 
decided that the toxic sub-Redditors, 
which he says are only .02 percent of the 
site’s users, were not free-speech martyrs 
but just “assholes trying to ruin Reddit.” 
And so he banned them.

Specifically, he subjected a handful of 
sub-Reddits to an outright ban and intro-
duced a quarantine system under which 
broadly offensive sub-Reddits would only 
be viewable by opt-in subscribers, who 
would need to sign up for them using an 
email address.

Unsurprisingly, the .02 percent were 
incensed. On the site, Huffman has been 
labeled an “inhuman shitstain” and “rac-
ist chucklefuck,” and a new sub- Reddit 
called Raping Spez was created. A num-
ber of those affected by his new content 
policy, including moderators of Coon-
town and Philosophy of Rape, decamped 
to a new site called Voat, claiming Reddit 
was on the brink of a mass evacuation.  
A user who goes by the name  GreatApeNiggy, 
who described himself to me as “just a guy 
that clicked the create button and made 
Coontown a reality,” told me that the ban 
will “slow down the spread of truth.” He 
thinks Huffman “will continue taking out 
sub-Reddit after sub-Reddit until Reddit is 
nothing but an extremist liberal hugbox 
and the average person moves on to some-
thing else.” Even moderators of less objec-
tionable content were angry about Huff-
man’s sudden retreat from being a bastion 
of free speech. “They can dance around the 
semantics of ‘That’s not why they created it.’ 
But the reality is, not long after it came into 
existence, that’s exactly what it became,” 
says Daniel Allen, founder of the popular 
forum Crappy Design. “Not that I agree that 
there should be sub-Reddits about beating 
women and racism—those are all distaste-
ful—but you don’t see the government shut-
ting down the KKK and the Westboro Bap-
tist Church.” Allen and some other 
moderators are convinced the decisions 
were made to make the site more corporate 
friendly. “The frustration comes from them 
saying one thing and doing another.”

For now, though, the ban appears to be 
working—there hasn’t been another big 
flap over terrible behavior, and the site is 
still attracting more users. Huffman says 
his focus is to repair the relationship with 

moderators and build out Reddit’s infra-
structure. “For better or for worse,” he 
says, “Reddit is very similar to the way it 
was back then.” He plans to at least double 
the “comically understaffed” site over the 
next year, and to pluck the abundant “low-
hanging fruit,” like creating a proper 
Reddit- branded mobile app and redesign-
ing the desktop homepage, which is still a 
schizoid jumble. Two of Huffman’s great 
interests are motorcycles and ballroom 
dance—while undergrads at UVA, he and 
his sister Amanda entered intercollegiate 
competitions as partners—but he says 
that not only does he not subscribe to sub-
Reddits about them, he isn’t sure whether 
such sub-Reddits exist. (They do.) Huff-
man knows this is a problem. “Reddit has 
this incredible breadth that most people 
aren’t even aware exists, and even if they 
are, like me, it still hasn’t even occurred to 
me to find some of those.”

He also professes not to be nearly as 
daunted as most outsiders by the eventual 
need to deliver the company’s investors a 
profit. Given Reddit’s sheer size, “we could 
monetize with half the efficiency of one of 
our competitors and make oodles more 
money than we’re doing now,” he says. 
Even in the face of user anonymity, adver-
tisers can still do click-tracking, and the 
list of an individual user’s idiosyncratic 
sub-Reddit subscriptions is nothing if not 
a precise psychographic profile of his inter-
ests. It’s not hard to imagine Reddit doing 
a lot more with native ads, which it has 
been experimenting with since 2009. 

Huffman says that mere advertising is 
“the most naïve” way to make money: 
“There are a thousand ways of making 
money on Reddit that are far, far more 
interesting.” He suggests, for instance, that 
future revenues could lie in positioning 
Reddit as a fee-based middleman for trans-
actions already taking place on the site and 
in selling data to celebrities and brands. 
“Wouldn’t they love to know what’s being 

said about them on Reddit? Certainly, they 
pay a shit-ton of money to Twitter for that, 
and you only get 140 characters at a time.”

In the short term, Reddit’s boldest effort 
to grow may lie in a project, overseen by 
Ohanian, called Amplify. The idea is to 
surface, curate, and publicize Reddit’s best 
content, which for years has been lucra-
tively pillaged by the likes of BuzzFeed. 
Ohanian has led the launch of a weekly 
podcast called Upvoted and an email 
newsletter called Upvoted Weekly, both of 
which focus on the most popular Reddit 
content. (Reddit has already launched  
a site within the site, also called Upvoted.) 
Ohanian also wants to change the way 
celebrities interact with Reddit, so that, 
instead of it being one more stop on a pub-
licity tour, it becomes a platform where 
they feel they have to maintain a continu-
ous presence, the same way they have to be 
on Twitter and Instagram. “Reddit’s already 
very, very large,” Huffman says. “I think we 
can be ten times larger.”

Huffman needs to be right. He is no lon-
ger a significant owner of the company, and 
though Advance treats Reddit as a passive 
investment, he now reports to a board with 
high expectations. If he is looking for any 
reminder of the vagaries of growth on the 
internet, he gets one daily, walking past the 
hand-drawn “Map of Online Communi-
ties” in 2007 that hangs along a corridor in 
Reddit’s offices. MySpace is a giant land-
mass, Friendster and Xanga respectably 
large nation-states, Facebook a middling 
duchy no larger than the adjacent Live-
Journal. Twitter isn’t even on the map, and 
Reddit is a speck, overshadowed by consid-
erably larger Digg. Only a few years later, 
Reddit would eclipse Digg, in part thanks 
to an event known as the Great Digg 
Migration, when Diggers alienated by a 
sudden and unwelcome redesign left en 
masse for Reddit.

Huffman insists he’s not worried about a 
Great Reddit Migration, now that Voat is 
holding itself out as a truly uncensored 
alternative. “Voat is just a copy of Reddit,” 
he says. “I wish them the best. I know their 
subscriber numbers are totally bogus, that’s 
obvious to me. We used to fake those num-
bers, too, when we were little, so I can’t 
blame them for that.”

Spoken with the blithe confidence of a 
chief executive. But Reddit wore on Huff-
man the last time around, and though he 
may have forgotten this during the excite-
ment surrounding his return, the anxiety 
has returned. “To say he has thick skin—
absolutely not,” says Adrienne Plaskett, his 
girlfriend, noting that, since returning to 
Reddit, Huffman has vomited from stress 
several times.  ■

“The Reddit job 
comes with a lot  
of baggage,  
but it’s easier for 
me, because I’m a 
founder, to say, 
‘Screw you guys.’ ”

STRATEGIST

for new yorkers lucky enough to have second (or third) homes in other cities and their environs—for  
doing business, visiting family, or just escaping winter—these residences afford an opportunity to have a little  

experimental fun when it comes to design. Take, for instance, designer Laura Kirar, who built a pink  
pool house (shown here) on the grounds of a crumbling 19th-century former sisal factory, or Luca Andrisani,  

who decided to plaster pretty much his entire Miami apartment in floor-to-wall-to-terrace blue tile.  PH

MARY WIKLER, 

Retired

What did you retire from? 
Well, I had a very checkered 
career: I moved to New  
York from New Jersey when  
I was 18 and worked as a 
secretary for the BBC. I had 
a mad crush on Alistair 
Cooke! I thought I wanted 
to be a model, so I went to 
meet with Eileen Ford, who 
ended up hiring me as her 
secretary—she fired me 
after two years because she 
said I was too slow. So I 
started my own agency—we 
represented Twiggy—but 
went off to be assistant to 
the actor Yul Brynner, who 
was dating my roommate  
at the time. I went on  
tour with him when we was 
starring in Home Sweet 
Homer—it’s on the wall of 
Joe Allen’s, because when  
it opened on Broadway  
it closed the same night. 
When I married my late 
husband, who was a  
doctor, I ended up as an 
administrator for the 
department of psychiatry  
at NYU Bellevue.

Working with models 
versus working with 
psychiatrists? 
Basically the same thing.

dinner engagements. Prix-fixe suppers are 
announced and ticketed online, attracting 
fans from the tristate area for intimate com-
munal meals with running commentary 
from the affable host. The vibe is laid-back. 
The service is friendly and informal. And 
the food is simple, rustic, and classically 
Tuscan—a loving tribute to Corcos’s Fiesole 

family home and the hunters, farm-
ers, and fishermen whose memory 
inspires his menus and TV show.  
In a word, Guy Fieri’s American 
Kitchen & Bar this is not.

There’s nothing groundbreaking 
about the day or night menu, but 
each has its charms. A Windsor 

Terracean out for a morning stroll could do 
worse than to stumble into the place for a 
coffee and a pancetta- Parmesan scone. 
Come lunchtime, the counter crew will 
rightly recommend something involving 
porchetta-style pork  shoulder—either an 
herb focaccia stuffed with morsels of the 
beer-braised meat or a bowl of pasta sauced 
with its rendered fat and dusted with 
Pecorino cheese. The pressed mortadella 
sandwich likewise hits the spot, and if one 
criticism can be made of the deftly dressed 
pastas, it’s that the kitchen relies on penne 
rigate as if it had forgotten that Italy has 
more shapes of pasta than Eskimos have 

words for snow. The classic pasta e fagioli, 
though, is beyond reproach, and the best 
reason yet not to regret summer’s end.

Unlike breakfast and lunch, the Tuscan 
Gun pop-up dinner has a familial spirit and 
a heartier menu. Each series is loosely 
themed, and the latest was “A Super Tuscan 
September”: a five-course feast served over 
two and a half hours and punctuated by 
Corcos’s dish-description interludes. So we 
learn that the chicken-liver crostino, bright 
with lemon zest, is his grandmother’s rec-
ipe; that the lush mushroom soup gets its 
texture from potato, not cream; that the 
 rabbit ragù lapping fresh pappardelle 
requires the meat to be painstakingly 
plucked from tiny bones; and that Italians 
aren’t fond of white-meat chicken, which 
will never cook up as tender as his succulent 
cacciatora. As at any casual dinner party, 
you might find yourself waiting for a spoon, 
or the next course, while the host hustles 
around the stove. But invariably, wine is 
shared, strangers become friends, groupies 
are charmed, and you’re transported—if not 
all the way to Tuscany, then to a little home-
spun sliver of it just off Prospect Park.

Y
ou can rest assured that the 
trio of giddy gals occupying the 
center table at the Tuscan Gun one 
recent Friday night didn’t road-

trip in from South Jersey just for a plate 
of crostini. No, they made the pilgrimage 
to Windsor Terrace to ogle and pose for 
selfies with one Gabriele Corcos, the 
lanky, ebullient, Italian-accented 
Cooking Channel chef who was 
hosting the meal. The Tuscan Gun, 
Corcos would have you know, is 
not a restaurant but rather, as the 
storefront window proclaims, 
officine and alimentari. This 
translates roughly to “workshop” 
and “grocery,” but the establishment is 
closer in practice to a café-slash-supper-
club-slash-brand-expansion, because 
these days, any self-respecting small-screen 
culinary personality needs a physical home 
base in which to test recipes and sell 
autographed cookbooks.

Since it appeared in May on a quiet resi-
dential block (Corcos’s own, in fact), the Tus-
can Gun has had a dual identity: espresso 
bar and sandwich shop by day, occasional 
pop-up Tuscan kitchen by night. This 
schedule has allowed Corcos and his wife, 
the actress Debi Mazar, to travel the country 
filming their show, Extra Virgin, between

Who would have thought the Oysterpocalypse
would be such an elegant afair?



Brooks Headley named his East Village canteen for the star meat-free 
burger, but some of the most exciting things to emerge from his kitchen are 
vegetable improvs that may materialize mid-meal, their names scribbled 
on notes taped to the wall. The new vegan cold pizza salad (neither pizza 
nor salad, in fact) is a recent example, one born of kitchen happenstance, 
as these things often are. Headley’s crew had mislaid a batch of chopped 
tomatoes destined for the creamed corn, and were pleased to discover that, 
when slow-cooked with black pepper, garlic, olive oil, and fennel seed, they 
came to smell and taste like pepperoni or Italian sausage. 
With some canny contrasts of flavor and texture—grid-
dled nut cheese, crushed bread sticks, bushels of basil—
Headley has managed to conjure a slice of pizza in the 
form of a juicy, crunchy, “cheesy” vegan side.  r.r. & r.p.

you might say that Rachel Allswang 
has been postponing the inevitable.  
She grew up in her mother Catherine’s 
restaurants in San Francisco and  
Paris, before trying her hand at interior  
design in New York. Now mother  
and daughter have combined their  
talents to open this 60-seat space 
encompassing four renovated lots—
one that was formerly used to raise 
pigeons. No squabs on the menu  
here, just some of Catherine’s modern 
bistro dishes like duck-fat potatoes 
with béarnaise and glazed flounder 
with sorrel jus, pictured. Rachel, who 
designed the restaurant, heads the 
front of the house, but mom still rules

Headley uses an 
“almost excessive

bruised basil—

“like when you get

CAL-MEX

Dimes’  
Summer Tacos; $8

This fluffy (the 
scrambled eggs), faintly 
spicy (the mango salsa 
and hot sauce), West 
Coast (the inevitable 
avocado) breakfast 

delicacy comes two to  
a plate at this popular 

little Canal Street 
operation, which is a 

good thing, because it’s 
more or less impossible  

to eat just one.  
49 Canal St., nr. Ludlow 

St.; 212-925-1300.

ALL-DAY

El Rey Coffee Bar & 
Luncheonette’s  

Avocado del Sur (with 
flatbread and two 

poached eggs); $12.50
We’re as weary as you are 
of all the avocado hype, 

but the most popular 
dish at this popular 

Lower East Side–meets–
Malibu establishment 
works as a comforting 
breakfast, a healthful 
lunch, or a pick-me-up 

afternoon snack.  
100 Stanton St., nr. Ludlow 

St.; 212-260-3950.

NOSHER STYLE

Baz Bagel & Restaurant’s 
Bunny Breakfast; $12

The entire Jewish-
appetizing canon is 

available at this modest 
Little Italy diner, but if 
you’ve been gorging  

on breakfasts for a week, 
the one we recommend 
is the Bunny: two sunny-

side eggs, a toasted 
bagel (made in-house),  

Nova salmon, with a  
few healthy slices  

of avocado on the side.  
181 Grand St., nr. Mulberry

ITALIAN

Santina’s  
Eggs a Piacere; $15

The key element here  
is the spicy potatoes, 
which are dipped in  
a mix of tomato and 
chiles and refried for  

an extra crunch. If you’re 
feeling rash, call for  
a bowl of the great 

house guanciale e pepe

the perfectly poached  
eggs on top.

on a Biscuit; $10

We love the buttermilk 
biscuit (as thick and 

sturdy as a small toaster) 
and the scrambled  
eggs (streaked with 
melted American 

cheese), but finish the 
entire creamy, rosemary-

rich smothering  
of sausage gravy and  

you won’t need to

rest of the week.

the more elegant ryokans

$20 for your omelette

also roughly four times

Jessica Ayromloo’s clients,  
a Manhattan couple with a 
duplex on the Upper East 

Side, first visited this Santa Monica loft 
one block from the beach, it was hard for 
them to get beyond the stuffy décor. 
“There were overbearing, floor-to-ceiling 
drapes everywhere. And so much beige,” 
Ayromloo says. The owners, who come to 
L.A. about once every six weeks or so, 
were going for an industrial, youthful 
vibe. So Ayromloo commissioned local 
artists to make installations out of perfo-
rated metal and a kitchen island of 
reclaimed wood. “Because we hired peo-
ple in the neighborhood, the owners were 
actually able to meet every person behind 
their artwork and custom pieces,” Ayrom-
loo says. She installed neon lights for the 
kitchen and a chandelier made of dis-
carded speakers, and kept the exposed 
metal piping in the ceilings to create an 
industrial feel. “Yes, everything feels 
graphic and cool, but the space is com-
fortable at heart,” Ayromloo explains. 
“The couple’s grandkids needed to be 
able to run across the dining-room ban-
quette. Nothing is too precious.”

ostly new york–based 
interior designer Juan Mon-
toya, who calls a one-bedroom 
near the Morgan Library 

home, realized he needed his own apart-
ment in Bogotá back in the 1980s. On his 
return trips home to the Colombian capi-
tal, he says, “I decided to buy an apart-
ment to be independent from the family 
but close enough to visit them frequently.” 
He found a new building still under con-
struction in the high-up Rosales neigh-
borhood, coveted for its views. As it was 
still being built, he was able to halt some 
of the finishing touches—for instance, he 
asked the contractor to leave the walls 
without their final coat of paint, then he 
whitewashed them to create a raw and

which was full of antiques, full of history”). 
The traditional pieces are paired with  
a Regency daybed and a 19th-century Ital-
ian chair in gold. “The first thing I do 
when I arrive in Bogotá,” he says, “is send 
over a menu of what I would like to eat at 
my mother’s house. Her cook will make 
the most wonderful ajiaco, a kind of chicken 
soup.” He visits about twice a year and is 
always tinkering with the design: “I like to 
move, do, add, and subtract, but mainly 
subtract and edit.”                                        w.g. PH

When Andrisani first saw the space, he thought  
to himself, “ ‘Oh, this is pretty.’ But when I saw the 

view, I was like, ‘Oh my God. Forget it. It’s 
amazing.’ ” The terrace is laid with the same tile 
found inside. The table and chairs, by Maurizio 

Tempestini, were bought at auction.

eing my own client was very 
strange,” New York architect Luca 
Andrisani says. “So I really went 
crazy with the concept—because 

I was able to.” That concept, for his loftlike 
North Miami Beach getaway, which he 
tries to visit monthly, was ’60s Italian design 
(“I’m reconnecting to my roots,” says Andri-
sani, a native Italian), and the craziness 
comes in via the Vietri tile, designed by Gio 
Ponti. The tile is everywhere, both in the 
apartment and on the terrace. “I went with 
it,” says Andrisani, who lives in a mostly 
cream-and-brown-hued Hell’s Kitchen 
apartment. “I still think of it as a minimal-
ist approach, because I just used one mate-
rial.” The rooms pick up the blues of Pon-
ti’s design, in the window treatments, the 
kitchen cabinetry, and the upholstery 
throughout. “Ponti specifically matched 
this tile to the water,” says Andrisani. 
“That’s why it was ideal. When you step in 
this, it’s the blue of the ocean.” The ocean 
features prominently in the apartment: 
“The way the space is structured,” says 
Andrisani, who created the open plan, 
“wherever you are, even if you are in the 
bathroom, you can see the water.”

The Accidental 
Hacienda
designer laura kirar and her  

husband stumbled  
on this abandoned factory  

near mérida and are  
now building a compound in  

the jungle.

Kirar and her husband, Richard Frazier, 
built a pool and pool house, which  

they’re living in while they renovate the 
main structures. “But we really live 

outside,” Kirar says, “and have all our  
meals under the trees by the pool.”

The counter sink is made of polished

a wood mold and rebar,” Kirar says. 

ine artist turned furniture 
and interior designer Laura Kirar 
was at a wedding in Mexico’s 
Yucatán Peninsula with her hus-

band, Richard Frazier, when they decided 
to take a drive. “We saw a smokestack in 
the distance, so we went to see what was 
there,” Kirar recalls. “We found what 
looked like an abandoned hacienda; we 
climbed the stone walls and 
saw these beautiful ruins.” 
The couple wandered around 
the property, when “suddenly 
there was a sun shower, and, 
I’m not kidding, a rainbow 
appeared. I said, ‘This is a sign 
we should live here.’ ” Kirar PH

and Frazier, who live in a Williamsburg 
loft, now visit the 40-acre Hacienda Subin, 
outside of Mérida, several times a year. On 
Saturdays, they go into the city for the Slow 
Food market. “We buy organic eggs, tama-
les. You can even get a decent bagel made 
by a Chicago expat,” Kirar says. She and 
Frazier built a pool and a two-bedroom 
pool house; they are staying there while 

they renovate the main 
buildings, a 1730s house and 
an 1890s former sisal fac-
tory that will hold a gallery 
and performance space. “It’s 
a future concept that awaits 
a roof,” says Kirar.

S
teven soderbergh is in motion.  
It’s a warm day in Greenpoint, and 
the 52-year-old director, cinematog-
rapher, editor, and executive pro-
ducer of Cinemax’s late- Victorian-era 
hospital drama The Knick is on the 
show’s main set, camera in hand, cir-

cling a table in a surgical theater, blocking a scene 
in which a patient’s gallbladder is removed. Soder-
bergh speaks softly. The cast and crew hang on 
every word. Then he starts shooting. He is moving, 
pausing, repositioning the actors, and moving 
some more. Technicians and writers gather just 
out of camera range, staring at an iPad that’s 
patched into Soderbergh’s camera via wireless, as 
the scene is sculpted and refined in real time. If 
you watch the screen, you can see aesthetic ques-
tions being asked and answered by the shifting 
positions of the actors in relation to Soderbergh’s 
lens. What is the point of this scene, this shot, this 
camera movement? Where is the best place to 
begin? On André Holland, who plays Algernon 
Edwards, the hospital’s acting chief of surgery? Or 
on Clive Owen, who plays Edwards’s onetime boss, 
the brilliant surgeon, medical inventor, and self-
destructive opium addict John W. “Thack” Thack-
ery? Perhaps the first shot should both start and 
end with a close-up of medical instruments used in 
the procedure? Would that be repetitious? Okay, 
maybe the shot should end farther away from the 
actors, and then the next shot should pick up in

Director
Steven Soderbergh can  
make a whole season  

of The Knick almost as fast  
as you can watch it.

the knick’s second season  
debuts October 16 on Cinemax.

close-up? Ah, yes, there we go, that worked. 
Much better. With its elaborately choreo-
graphed and composed long shots, this is 
the kind of scene that might take three 
hours to complete on network hospital dra-
mas and even longer on Hollywood movies. 
Soderbergh knocks it out in less than two.

His direction of The Knick is unusual in 
pretty much every imaginable way, but let’s 
start with the fact that it’s all his: Soder-
bergh helmed the entirety of the show’s first 
ten-episode season, which aired 
late last year, and did the same 
for season two, which premieres 
on October 16. For all of its 
visual evolution in recent 
decades, TV is still a writer-pro-
ducer’s medium where series 
directors rotate in and out as 
needed, rarely overseeing more 
than two or three episodes in a 
row. Occasionally one person 
might direct eight back-to-back 
episodes of a limited- run project 
like The Honorable Woman 
(Hugo Blick) or True Detective’s 
first season (Cary Joji Fukun-
aga). And once in a great while 
you’ll see the majority of a long- 
running series directed by a 
single person, as with Louie 
(Louis C.K.)—but rarely on a 
show with as many moving 
parts as The Knick, and in such 
a punishingly tight time frame. 
Soderbergh has now directed 20 
hours of a lavish costume drama at the 
speed of a run-and-gun indie film: Both 
seasons wrapped, according to The Knick 
co-creator and co-writer Jack Amiel, in 
about 150 days, “which is less time than a lot 
of crews would spend shooting one big 
movie.” The Knick shoots eight to nine 
script pages a day, double the typical rate for 
a TV drama, and burns through an hour-
long episode in just seven days, versus the 
industry norm of ten to 14.

The Knick’s second season opens with a 
good portion of the main cast scattered to 
the winds: Thack has been ousted as chief 
of surgery for his drug use and is feeding his 
addiction by performing facial reconstruc-
tions on syphilis victims; the former nun 
Sister Harriet (Cara Seymour) has been 
kicked out of the order for facilitating abor-
tions; hospital-board member Cornelia 
Robertson (Juliet Rylance) is in San Fran-
cisco agitating against the quarantine of 
Chinese- Americans during a bubonic-
plague epidemic. The first couple of new 
episodes maneuver them back into the 
Knickerbocker Hospital and set the season’s 
plot in motion, mixing in more signifiers of 
the city’s ongoing evolution toward moder-

nity, such as the replacement of the hospi-
tal’s horse-drawn carriage with “horseless” 
ones and the increased prominence of elec-
tric lightbulbs.

The show’s style is different, too. More 
so than in season one, scenes in season two 
often consist of long, sinuous camera 
moves and a few tight close-ups. Some-
times, during a scene with long mono-
logues, Soderbergh will focus on the face of 
a single listening character and not cut 

away. “There are moments 
when you don’t think it’s your 
scene, but it is,” says Eve Hew-
son, who plays ER nurse Lucy 
Elkins, Thackery’s lover. The 
Knick can look more like a John 
Ford or William Wyler or Orson 
Welles movie, in which every 
image is carefully considered, 
than most modern scripted TV, 
where the goal is mainly to cap-
ture performances and push the 
story along. Soderbergh men-
tions Welles’s The Trial and 
Chimes at Midnight, in particu-
lar, as influences on the look of 
season two, with their “sus-
tained shots that go on forever.” 
“It’s kind of like the arcade game 
with the water-filled tube and 
the ball,” he says during a lunch 
that lasts exactly 18 and a half 
minutes. “How long can I keep 
this shot interesting, dynamic, 
and narratively appropriate to 

what’s going on, given the elements that 
I want to emphasize?”

Soderbergh shoots with a handheld 
camera, sometimes while being pushed by 
grips on a small, wheeled platform that he 
calls a “dolly du derrière.” This allows him 
to participate in scenes as an equal with his 
actors, rather than being “50 feet away, 
behind the monitor,” he says. “I like the 
intimacy of that, and I think the actors like 
knowing how close I am.” Watching him 
direct is akin to witnessing an athletic per-
formance. Soderbergh walks, jogs, runs, 
sits, lies on the floor, and hangs half off dol-
lies while PAs grip his ankles. “When I tell 
other cameramen what goes on with Ste-
ven, they’re flabbergasted,” says Soder-
bergh’s longtime second cameraman, Pat-
rick O’Brien, who works on only about 30 
percent of The Knick—usually when 
Soderbergh needs him to gather extra 
close-ups in a scene with a lot of charac-
ters, operate a crane that he’s sitting on, 
or shoot the other side of a two-person 
conversation. “He’s like a dancer,” says 
Holland. “One time, on the first season, it 
was bitter winter and we were shooting 
outside, and he was in this awkward, 

crouched-down position, holding the cam-
era and moving at the same time, and mid-
way through the take, his knee gave out 
and he jumped up and winced in pain. 
You could hear a pin drop, because you 
know that his physicality is such a huge 
part of the show.”

Everything and everyone on set is 
enabling Soderbergh’s endurance test. An 
assistant cameraperson shifts focus via 
remote control from another room, freeing 
Soderbergh to concentrate on movement 
and framing. The Knick’s standing sets 
are lit with visible (or “practical”) lights—
desk lamps, chandeliers, and so forth—to 
let Soderbergh and his actors move any-
where they want and still get a lovely 
image. Everyone knows that they have to 
be as politely relentless and focused as 
their boss. There are no stand-ins on the 
set of The Knick, no Gulfstream trailers for 
producers and cast, and no canvas chairs, 
because no one sits still long enough to 
require them. A workday here is a nine-to-
six sprint, with an hour off for lunch. 
“Actors love working with this guy,” O’Brien 
says, “because they’re not sitting around 
all day waiting for the set to be lit.” Soder-
bergh tells me: “It keeps the actors on the 
boil, nobody leaves, and—like we just 
did—you can power through the whole 
scene and it’s done.” 

Soderbergh’s preferred digital camera, 
the Red Epic Dragon, also helps. Its low-
light capacity has let him shoot handsomely 
composed scenes, starkly illuminated by a 
naked lightbulb, a gas lamp, even a match—
cinematographic flourishes in the spirit of 
one of his favorite movies, Stanley Kubrick’s 
1975 drama Barry Lyndon, the first feature 
to shoot scenes by candlelight. At one point 
during our conversation, Soderbergh digs 
his cell phone out of his pocket and calls up 
a two-minute tracking shot from season 
two in which Cornelia Robertson moves 
“through a house with a candle and we fol-
low her, and that’s it. Just one candle, and 
you can see everything!” he says, marveling 
at the flickering image on his phone. 

Most directors would not get handed 
a handsome period drama to treat as their 
own personal train set, but that’s because 
they don’t have Soderbergh’s track record 
of making stylish, innovative, occasionally 
commercial art cheap and fast and without 
much fuss. Since his 1989 debut, the 
Cannes Palme d’Or winner sex, lies and 
videotape, he has directed 25 features 
(including the four-and-a-half-hour, two-
part biopic Che) plus nearly 30 hours of TV 
(including the 2003 HBO political satire 
K Street, each episode of which was plot-
ted, scripted, shot, cut, and broadcast in 
five days). He is one of the few American

directors to claim two Oscar nominations 
for Best Picture during a single calendar 
year, for 2000’s Erin Brockovich and Traf-
fic; he won Best Director for the latter. 
Every one of his movies—including the 
comparatively glossy heist thrillers Ocean’s 
Eleven, Twelve, and Thirteen—was pro-
duced for what is, by contemporary Ameri-
can studio standards, chump change.

And he is endlessly, perhaps helplessly, 
prolific. In 2010, he told his friend Matt 
Damon that he was “retiring” from making 
theatrical features because he felt he’d 
exhausted the medium—a statement that 
was widely misinterpreted to mean that 
Soderbergh was quitting the business 
entirely and that launched a thousand jokes 
along the lines of “In the time it took you to 
read this tweet about Soderbergh’s retire-
ment, he directed a remake of Berlin Alex-
anderplatz.” Right now he’s got The Knick; 
a show in the works at HBO with Sharon 
Stone; and an executive- producer credit on 
Amazon’s new Red Oaks, a  circa-1985 
period drama directed by David Gordon 

Green (Pineapple Express). He’s fascinated 
by long-form storytelling, which he says is 
“very different” from features and offers 
more possibilities for experimentation, 
because TV’s aesthetic hasn’t been devel-
oped as deeply as cinema’s. Whole seasons 
of The Knick are written before a frame is 
shot, and any subsequent revisions are 
about in-the-moment problem solving. 
“Having all ten scripts beforehand allows 
me to sort of think on a macro level for lon-
ger, and that’s good for me,” he says.

Soderbergh thinks like an editor while 
he’s shooting, never wasting anyone’s time 
on anything he thinks he might not use. 
“Steven doesn’t cover the same thing 19 
times,” says Amiel. “He’s going to do it once 
and know that’ll be his first half of the 
scene and we’re not going to shoot it again. 
[For] the second half of the scene, he may 
shoot three or four pieces of coverage, but 
it’s because he’s already cut the whole scene 
in his head. He already knows.” “Often the 
shot that ends up in the show is the first one 
that we got,” says Holland. “Early on he said 

to me, ‘I don’t see any reason why we need 
to make things any more complicated than 
they have to be.’ ”

At 6 p.m. each day, Soderbergh climbs 
into the backseat of a van and starts cutting 
the day’s footage on a laptop on the way 
home from the set. He finishes by eight, 
posts the results on a password-protected 
website, and goes to dinner, a play, or a 
movie with his wife, Jules Asner. “People on 
the crew will say, ‘I can’t wait to see what we 
did today,’ ” says production designer How-
ard Cummings. Changes in technology have 
allowed Soderbergh to become imagina-
tively fused to his digital cameras, laptop, 
smartphone, and the internet. “I have to 
show this to you; I can probably pull it up on 
my phone,” Soderbergh says, hunting 
through footage folders on The Knick’s post-
production website and calling up an acro-
batic long take that follows actors through a 
fund-raising ball. “If I had this shit at the 
beginning of my career,” he says as the phone 
screen fills up with costumed extras, “the 
movies would’ve been a lot better.”  ■

Terry O’Neill’s new book, Two Days That 
Rocked the World: Elton John Live at Dodger 

Stadium, documents the rock superstar’s October 1975 career-
peak concerts. But the photographer didn’t know at the time  
that John was about to enter a valley. “He used to go onstage

the scene

Here, the book’s 
protagonist, 
François,  
a professor who 
specializes in 
decadent 19th-
century writer 
J. K. Huysmans,  
is choosing a 
prostitute online 
in the year 2022.

the problem

“The translation 
was finding  
its rhythm,” says 
Stein. “But very 
near to the end of 
the book, there 
was this sentence 
that hadn’t seemed 

funny to me and 
that I couldn’t 
translate.”  
He discussed the 
problem with his 
editor, Mitzi Angel, 
who grew up 
speaking French.
 

the first, 

failed attempt

“At first I wrote, 
‘Given the political 
situation, choosing 
a Muslim turned 
me on.’ But this 
was very un-
Houellebecqian. 
It’s too fast, the 
emphasis falls at 
the end of the 
sentence, the tone 

is ponderously 
casual.”

the aha 

moment

“One of us came 
up with arouse: 
‘Arousing, in a 
way’—for me, that’s 
how Houellebecq 
sounds. And even 
though the syntax 
doesn’t track the 
French exactly, it 
preserves the air 
of anticlimax, the 
slight fussiness, 
the stoicism  
of the original.  
The sentence 
became less 
brutal, less vulgar.”

the revisions

“Figuring out that 
one sentence made 
me go back to the 
beginning and  
try to preserve this 
tone that’s a bit 
Buster Keaton–
ish. It’s a little slow, 
a little narcotized.” 

the final result

“Houellebecq has 
the reputation of 
writing bad prose. 
The more time  
I spent with this 
book, the more 
impressed I was. 
He doesn’t put in 
extra brushstrokes.”

a lot better for action scenes.”

Drake & Future’s what a time to be alive is available now.

I
n late september, The Fader published Drake’s first major 
magazine interview in a year and a half, which is how long it’s 
been since Rolling Stone had pulled his promised cover at the last 
minute and instead eulogized Philip Seymour Hoffman. (“RIP 
to Phillip Seymour Hoffman [sic],” Drake tweeted about this 

perceived injustice. “All respect due. But the press is evil.”) In the Fader 
profile, the artist formerly known as Jimmy Brooks speaks candidly 
about his creative process. One of the interview’s most revealing 
moments comes when Drake explains why he likes to remix hit songs 
by up-and-coming artists like Migos and, more recently, Mississauga 
crooner Ramriddlz. “I’ll hear people’s stuff,” Drake said, “and ... It’s just, 
literally, I’ve recognized the potential and the greatness in this piece 
and I want to take my stab at it, too.”

The modern Drake remix as we know it 
dates to mid-2013, when he dropped a few 
verses on a rereleased version of Migos’s 
“Versace.” It was a well-timed assist; 
Drake’s remix helped the song crack the 
Billboard “Hot 100.” And he did  something 
similar last August, when he released his 
own version of rising DIY-R&B oddball 
ILoveMakonnen’s “Club Going Up on a 
Tuesday.” The original song was probably 
too strange for radio, but radio was not 
going to ignore a new Drake.

Drake’s recent remixes, though, haven’t 
been as generous. His version of 
 Ramriddlz’s “Sweeterman” doesn’t even 
feature the Ramriddlz’s voice, and his cur-
rent smash, “Hotline Bling,” owes such 
heavy stylistic debts to the Virginia rapper 
D.R.A.M.’s “Cha Cha” that people have 
dubbed it “Hotline Bling (Cha-Cha 
Remix).” Are these homages or erasures? It 
depends. You could see it as a popular artist 
sharing the spotlight and giving upstarts 
strategic boosts into the mainstream. Or 
you could see a high-school queen bee who 
begrudgingly befriends the new “It” girl 
just so, down the line, she can claim credit 
for her popularity.

I can pinpoint the day I jumped from 
the former camp to the latter: May 5, 
when Drake released his remix of Fetty 
Wap’s hit “My Way.” Fetty’s ascent to star-
dom didn’t need a boost: “Trap Queen” 
was already well on its way to becoming a 
song-of- the-summer juggernaut. Drake’s 
past artist endorsements have been 
endearingly left-field, but this one—obvi-
ous, a little greedy—felt off-brand.

Drake is not the only famous rapper 
who does this stuff. But the difference is 
that, “Trap Queen” aside, Drake’s remixes 
often eclipse the originals. What he’s 
doing feels more in line with what Taylor 
Swift has been doing on her 1989 tour: 
inviting hitmakers onstage to duet on one 
of their songs, thus making it hers, too. 

This summer it became fashionable to 
make fun of Taylor’s effort to become our 
all-conquering pop overlord, but Drake’s 
methods for staying on top are seen as 
beyond reproach. Meek Mill’s accusations 
that Drake uses ghostwriters, and Drake’s 
eventual shrug, have only made him 
stronger. Whatever Drake does becomes 
the new normal.

on sunday,  September 20, Drake 
 surprise-released What a Time to Be 
Alive, an 11-song collaboration with 
Atlanta rapper Future. The release would 
sell nearly 375,000 copies in its first week, 
which gave wattba the third-highest 
debut week of any album this year, bested

by Drake’s other surprise-release mixtape, 
If You’re Reading This It’s Too Late, which 
just became the only 2015 album to 
 surpass a million copies sold. Drake has 
completely dominated the album chart in 
2015 without putting out a proper album.
wattba has been widely regarded as a 

mixtape, although that’s a funny word. 
Some think a mixtape these days is any-
thing released for free online; purists 
believe something with original beats 
doesn’t qualify. But wattba features  
all-new beats from Metro Boomin (and 
others), and tons of people paid for it on 
iTunes. It’s easy to think that the digital 
era has hastened the Death of the Album, 
but Drake’s approach has actually buoyed 
the idea that the album is the format for 
an artist’s most meaningful statements. 
He’s called wattba “a little soundtrack for 
people that need it right now,” the most 
revealing word in that phrase being little. 
He also spoke of If You’re Reading This 
self- critically in that Fader interview: 
“There’s corners cut …” The tossed-off 
release strategies of these efforts are the 
ultimate humble brags. Drake knows that 
right now even his drafts will be sales 
blockbusters.
wattba is a minor release for Drake 

and Future both, which means that, once 
again, Drake’s involvement here seems 
more strategic than anything. Future is 
having a hot year, and it feels like a good 
time for Drake to have this guy publicly 
on his side. And vice versa. In July, 
Future’s Dirty Sprite 2 sold 140,000 copies 
in its first week. wattba did almost triple 
that—such is the Drake Bump. 

Something about all of this makes Fetty 
Wap’s tuneful, spirited self-titled debut 
album, which came out on September 25, 
feel like even more of an achievement.  
I can’t remember the last time you could 
say this about a high-profile rap release, 
but nobody on this record was famous a 
year ago. There are no career-sanctioning 
guest verses from superstars, no hooks 
sung by up-and-coming starlets—just 
Fetty, his Remy Boyz crew, and their  
infectious exuberance. I can’t recall the 
last time a 20-song album moved with 
such spring in its step.

Fetty Wap hits a sweet spot between 
the familiar and strange—palatable 
enough for mass appeal, but singular 
enough to feel like a thoroughly personal 
vision. But more important, his story will 
serve as an inspiring tale for plenty of 
aspiring rappers without the assistance of 
a well-connected benefactor. Drake’s co-
sign is already a forgettable blip in the 
narrative. Fetty’s rise was his alone.  ■

99 Homes illustrates 
something about

which is how  
the upper class  
persuades lower- 
income people to 
vote against their 
own best interests.

with this idea of ce-
lebrity. Hopefully I’m 
just more myself as  
I get older and grow, 
but in our culture 
they’re telling us to be 
something totally 
fucking different.
You feel like the cul-
ture is hostile to you?
Yes. I’m not accepted. 
None of us are accepted 
in this culture. We’re 
only accepted if we are 
… well, name it.
Successful?
White.
White, famous,  
heterosexual É
… Handsome, charis-
matic, thin-enough 
eyebrows to be beau-
tiful but thick enough 
to still be masculine. 
We’re told constantly 
that we’ll never be 
enough. It’s that dan-
gling-carrot thing. 
That was my experi-
ence with Spider-
Man. It’s like, “My life 
is now great!” But in 
fact, I’m still fucked 
up in my own ways, 
and insecure, and 
scared, and don’t re-
ally know who I am. 

Celebrity is the new 
religion, as far as  
I can see, along with 
money, power, status.
When the paparazzi 
take your picture, 
you often hold up a 
sign listing charita-
ble causes. Is that 
the best way to com-
modify your own ce-
lebrity, to figure out 
something worthy 
to channel it into?
I struggle with this 
question every day. 
Who am I? Do I have 
anything to say?
If you tell people 
what you think 
about world issues, 
is that a risk to your 
celebrity?
That’s the thing.  
My priority is the 
work, and the work  
is dependent on  
people not knowing 
much about me. So 
where’s the balance? 
Where’s the line that 
I have to walk?  
Because I do want to 
make a difference in 
the world, I really do, 
and that’s a really 
cheesy thing to want. 

“why the fuck am i doing this?” asked 
Andrew Garfield. He was sitting in a Beverly 
Hills hotel room, recalling the dread he’d felt 
that morning as he faced a long day of press to 
promote his new film, the housing-bubble 
drama 99 Homes. “Coming in today to do 
interviews, I’m like, Why? I know that I’m an 
actor and it’s part of the job, and I feel lucky I get 
to do that, but it’s such a weird thing. What do  
I have to say?”  kyle buchanan

asked to join this 
movie?
Yeah, in a much less 
articulate way.
I didnÕt think I was 
all that articulate.
For me, it was  
very articulate.  
You fucking said it.  
Hearing you talk, I 
just suddenly feel like 
my head is wrapped 
in cellophane. Why 
don’t you just do this 
interview? You’re  
saying the right shit.
I donÕt think my  
editors would  
appreciate it if I 
wrote only “Andrew 
Garfield nods 
periodically.”
Just attribute what 
you’re saying to me. 
Yeah, I struggle with 
it, man. I struggle 
with it because I’m an 

actor, right? And I do 
believe that films like 
this are a part of the 
slow change that  
every movement  
undergoes. It’s 
through story telling 
that I’m able to ask 
the question “What 
power do I have?”
Have you found 
wealth and power to 
be seductive? 
Yeah, I have. Some-
thing shifted with 
[playing] Spider-
Man. It was a charac-
ter that I wanted to 
play my whole life, 
and not one part of 
me was indifferent … 
but I got incredibly 
uncomfortable with 
the attention that 
came with that job.  
It was nothing to do 
with me, it was to do PH

ever invented by our species 
for housing and fabricating 
faith on Earth are those 
incredible stone edifices 
meant to conspire with the 
higher forces, the tools for 
knowing God that we call 
churches. In a series of huge, 
riveting, incredibly intricate 
photographic composites—
some using as many as  
2,000 digital images blended 
together to create an 
idealized form, with the 
highest spires rendered in  
the same painstaking detail 
as the lowest steps—the 
German-born Markus

wonder about lofty spiritual 
intangibles as well as the lives 
of the people who built and 
believed in these buildings 
and religions. Brunetti’s 
depiction (at left) of the 
cathedral in Magdeburg, 
Germany, put me on zap 
with its daring visual 
distortion and newly revealed 
symmetries. It’s so unreal it 
becomes its own reality: a 
trip to a weird architectural-
digital-cosmic plane.

CRITICS

the playfully dead-serious drama Experimenter depicts the life of Stanley 
Milgram (Peter Sarsgaard), the Yale social scientist who, in 1961, directed his sub-

jects (“teachers”) to deliver shocks of escalating severity to a “learner” in order to gauge their 
level of obedience to “malevolent authority.” The writer-director, Michael Almereyda, clearly 
sees his protagonist as a master of stagecraft as well as psychology, and he gives the movie 
a whiff of the circus—a gorgeous, photo realist circus, often against 
tinted black-and-white backdrops that push its ringmaster into the 
foreground. Milgram talks to us, shows us things. He puts his work in 
historical context. He expounds on the role of obedience in turning 
individuals into instruments of the state—as in Nazi Germany. The 
word reflective suggests a slowdown or cessation of action proper, but 
Experimenter is busily, thrillingly reflective. Its artificiality makes it 
seem even more alive, more in the present tense.

I’ve known Almereyda for 35 years (since college) and always mar-
veled at his capacity to keep experimenting in the face of commercial 

m o v i e s   /   t h e a t e r   /   b o o k s

apathy, rarely with budgets of more than a 
million dollars. His modern, deadpan-funny 
Hamlet (with Ethan Hawke) was a true 
Shakespeare movie—a rethinking of what 
individual action even means in a corporate-
media-saturated state. In other films, he’s 
occasionally been too cool for his own good. 
His passion comes out in dense networks of 
references and footnotes, but he’ll rarely 
bring himself to—as a less scrupulous artist 
would say—go in for the kill. Something 
about Milgram’s single- mindedness and 
drive liberates Almereyda. Milgram’s prank-
ishness, perhaps. (The conformity experi-
ments had spiritual ties to Candid Camera.) 
Or his Jewishness. Or perhaps—contradict-
ing my complaint above—Milgram’s irrita-
tion at being perceived as too cool, even anti-
human, when his moral urgency is plain.

Sarsgaard brings out every bit of tension 
between Milgram’s humanism and clinical 
objectivity. Milgram studies the “teachers” 
(among them a movingly anguished John 
Leguizamo) as they writhe in indecision, 
reluctant to give higher jolts of electricity to 
a man in the next room crying out in pain 
(actually a performer on Milgram’s payroll 
played by the mock-querulous comedian 
Jim Gaffigan): Milgram looks like a stereo-
typical Nazi scientist himself. Is he? You 
have to study Sarsgaard closely. Early in his 
career, the actor was almost too perfectly 
cast as the son of John Malkovich in The 
Man in the Iron Mask; he has the same 
weighty (but weirdly spaced) intonations 
and semi-hysterical head voice. But it takes 
real talent to suggest a mind so full of 
momentous ideas. Watch Sarsgaard press 
his case with Milgram’s colleagues, bending 
toward them as if his soul were in his fore-
head. He’s so in the world. Sarsgaard has a 
delightful partner in Winona Ryder as Mil-
gram’s wife, who can’t wait to roll up her 
sleeves and feel what it’s like to be shocked. 

Experimenter is uncannily beautiful. Pro-
duction designer Deana Sidney creates a 
palette of blue-grays and cool greens that’s 
like a Platonic dream of social science before 
the counterculture blew out the walls. Bryan

Senti’s music finds a balance between scien-
tific detachment and sorrow over the human 
capacity for cruelty, with a hint of Jewish-
ness in the lachrymose violins. The movie’s 
spell holds even when it becomes more dif-
fuse in the second half, after Milgram is pil-
loried for not affirming human goodness 
and (allegedly) traumatizing his subjects. 
Accused of peddling a view of mankind as 
inherently evil, he’s actually a “situationist.” 
He believes that many people under some 
conditions could go against their morals if 
ordered to do so. But his conformity experi-
ments showed differences among cultures. 
In Experimenter, a Dutchman—from a cul-
ture with “a history of defiance”—has an 
easier time than Americans in 1961 saying 
no. The movie ends with Milgram asserting 
we can be puppets but still have free will—
which would be even freer if we could learn 
to “see the strings” on us.

Almereyda shows us the strings. I don’t 
know why in two scenes an elephant follows 
Milgram down a corridor, but I’d like to 
believe he’s suggesting viewers will accept 
anything as part of their natural obedience 
to a film director. In this case, he’s right.

with his sober but stirring Cold War 
suspense film Bridge of Spies, Steven Spiel-
berg continues his creative evolution from 
fatherless child to nervous father wondering 
(absent role models) if he’s doing the right 
thing in the right way. His protagonist is 
James Donovan (Tom Hanks), a Brooklyn 
insurance lawyer tasked with defending a 
British-born Soviet citizen named Rudolf 
Abel (Mark Rylance) against the charge of 
spying for the Soviets. We see in the first 
(masterly) sequence that Abel is indeed a spy 
(no mystery), but Donovan wants the court 
to regard the man not as a traitor to be exe-
cuted but a foreign soldier doing his duty—
and bravely refusing to give up information. 
In this most nebulous of conflicts in a world 
that could nonetheless end in a nuclear 
instant, a figure like Abel would look mighty 
good strapped in the electric chair. But 
 Donovan—though pilloried—stands tall.

The movie—written by Matt Charman 
and Ethan and Joel Coen, based on a true 
story—is explicitly a dramatization of per-
sonal integrity amid social madness. And 
Spielberg can be pretty explicit. But as Lin-
coln showed, he has a grown-up passion for 
the subtle arts of negotiation and persua-
sion. Donovan embodies the idea that no 
matter how corrupt the system, a princi-
pled, talented individual can set right the 
most battered and bloody ship of state. 
Even the government that dislikes and 
publicly dissociates itself from him sends 
him on a secret mission: trading Abel for a 
downed U-2 pilot (Austin Stowell), who 
 disappointed his leaders by not committing PH

suicide before capture. The “bridge of spies” 
is where the exchange will take place, in  
a newly walled-off East Berlin.

Is it worth saying again that I miss Hanks 
the impudent comedian and wish he weren’t 
so often the standard-bearer for American 
decency? Okay, I’ve said it. He’s still impres-
sive—he makes you feel Donovan’s struggle 
to keep a clear head while stumbling (with a 
lousy cold) among shadowy antagonists in a 
frigid East Berlin, a maze of doublespeak 
interrupted by machine-gun fire at poor 
souls scaling the wall.

Spielberg evokes that free-floating 
 malevolence superbly, though he founders 
when shoehorning in the plight of an Amer-
ican student arrested as a spy. In the large 
cast, Amy Ryan has disgracefully little to do 
as Donovan’s wife, but various dour agents 
are convincing and Mikhail Gorevoy has a 
deliciously evocative Peter Lorre timbre as 
a KGB mastermind. It’s Rylance who keeps 
Bridge of Spies standing. He gives a teeny, 

witty, fabulously non-emotive performance, 
every line musical and slightly ironic—the 
irony being his forthright refusal to deceive 
in a world founded on lies. The poetic 
embodiment of fatalism, he is Donovan’s 
closest ally in terms of integrity but his 
opposite when it comes to slogging away on 
behalf of lost causes.

i’ll have more to say next issue about 
the much-anticipated Room, a film of 
intense close-ups with the breadth of a hur-
ricane. It’s told from the point of view of a 
5-year-old (Jacob Tremblay, an instant star) 
whose mother (the phenomenally credible 
Brie Larson) has kept from him the knowl-
edge that they’re both prisoners of a psycho-
path in a shed. Despite a score with too many 
shimmering plinks, it’s a breathtakingly 
clear-eyed portrait of a child’s capacity—
when guarded by a loving parent—to project 
warmth and even the illusion of space onto 
the most malignant environment.  ■

it’s only fitting that Atlantic Records is releasing its recording of Hamilton 
in a variety of formats that, like the hit musical itself, rewind history. The download 

went on sale September 25; the CD comes out October 16. According to a tweet from Lin-
Manuel Miranda, the show’s author, there will also be an actual LP, that throwback medium 
embedding the topography of a score in warpy spirals of vinyl. The LP, should it happen, 
would return us nearly to the dawn of the original-cast-album era, when Decca managed to 
fit not quite all of Oklahoma! on six ten-inch double-sided 78-rpm platters. 

As much as the technology has changed since 1943, the business model for original cast

recordings—call them OCRs, but not 
soundtracks, please—has changed even 
more. In the old days, major labels bid for 
the rights to record and release major mu-
sicals. If flops were preserved, it was usually 
by accident: a record producer’s unlucky bet 
on a horse that went lame. Now, even 
though major labels aren’t much interested 
in musical theater unless, as with Hamil-
ton, they perceive major crossover appeal, 
nearly everything is recorded, from spec-
taculars to duds to four-person Fringe re-
vues. Last season tells the story. Fifteen 
musicals opened on Broadway between 
June 2014 and April 2015; though at least 
nine were flops, 14 got cast recordings. (The 
15th, Holler If Ya Hear Me, was apparently 
recorded but never released.) This despite 
the likelihood that most of these cast re-
cordings, even the ones whose shows are 
hits, will not prove profitable.

Last season’s 14 Broadway cast recordings are generally as good or bad as the 
shows they were made from. But not always. Ranked reviews below.

1. FUN HOME (PS CLASSICS) 
Even more intimate, and eventually more 

terrifying, than in the theater. Listen straight 
through. (Objectivity caveat:  

I wrote the liner-notes essay—not that 
anyone reads liner notes anymore.) 

2. THE KING AND I (DECCA BROADWAY) 
Beautifully sung, and oh, that orchestra,  

here enhanced from the 29 in the pit to 40. 
The fullest account to date of  

the score—including the amazing original  

dance music by Trude Rittmann.

3. HONEYMOON IN VEGAS (UNIVERSAL) 
Jason Robert Brown’s songs, channeling 

MGM circa 1950, swing and shine  
without the icky book and blah production 

that deadened them onstage.

4. ON THE TOWN (PS CLASSICS) 
Joyful and solid and free of the production’s 
sometimes annoying desperation to please. 

5. THE LAST SHIP (UNIVERSAL MUSIC CLASSICS) 
Sting’s folk-oriented pop didn’t dramatize  

the action of the gloomy musical  
very well but works beautifully as a kind of 

atmospheric singspiel on the OCR.  
Bonus track: The composer sings an encore 

of “What Say You, Meg?”

6. THE VISIT (BROADWAY/YELLOW SOUND) 
A bit sepulchral in the theater, Kander and 

Ebb’s final score comes alive on the 
atmospheric OCR, with a chilling star turn 

by Chita Rivera. 

7. SOMETHING ROTTEN (GHOSTLIGHT) 
Like many big-fun spoofs—see also  
The Producers and Spamalot—the 

workmanlike score of this musical about  
the invention of musicals loses  

something on multiple hearings.  

8. IT SHOULDA BEEN YOU (GHOSTLIGHT) 
This mismatched-wedding-party musical 

seemed hopelessly dated in the theater,  
but guess what? Dated musicals  

can sound pretty good in your earbuds. 

9. ON THE TWENTIETH CENTURY (PS CLASSICS)
Kristin Chenoweth adjusts her  

sensational comic performance perfectly  
for this revival cast recording,  

but nothing can make up for the vastly 
reduced orchestrations heard here.

10. AN AMERICAN IN PARIS  

(SONY/MASTERWORKS BROADWAY) 
Jukebox musicals, even classy ones like this 

Gershwin pastiche, don’t record well; 
reverting to their original form, the songs 

don’t hang together. Stick with Ella. 

11. SIDE SHOW (BROADWAY):
For those who love the screamy 1997 OCR, 

this more-disciplined revival cast album  
may seem like weak tea; for me, it’s  

an improvement, which is not saying much. 

12. GIGI (DMI SOUNDTRACKS) 
This is what downloadable singles are for:  
a schizy show filled with botched numbers 

but a few gorgeous ones, too. You can  
get Victoria Clark’s “Say a Prayer” for $1.29.

13. FINDING NEVERLAND (REPUBLIC) 
Bombast and treacle aren’t a good 

combination, and they tend to curdle when 
preserved. Matthew Morrison belts up  

a storm, to no avail.

14. DOCTOR ZHIVAGO (BROADWAY) 
This is what downloadable singles aren’t for. 

Strictly for completists and students of  
the grotesque. (You will have to pay  

$1.29 to discover for yourself whether the 
vomiting song has been included.)

Two things are at play here. The major 
labels began to abandon Broadway when 
most OCRs, typically selling fewer than 
50,000 copies, could no longer recoup the 
expenses of making and selling them. (Only 
five of last season’s shows were recorded by 
big names like Sony, Universal, and Decca.) 
At the same time, the advent of digital mu-
sic made production and distribution a 
much simpler process, available to almost 
anyone. As the major labels moved out, new 
boutique labels like Sh-K-Boom and PS 
Classics therefore emerged with novel busi-
ness models to exploit the old niche and 
record the shows that would otherwise be 
lost to history.

It is still rather expensive to do that; ac-
cording to Brian Drutman, a recording con-
sultant specializing in musicals, a Broadway 
OCR costs about $400,000 to make. But in 
many cases it’s no longer the labels paying.

Instead, the productions themselves are. A 
show that might ordinarily raise $10 million 
for its Broadway capitalization might now, 
without much more effort, raise $10.4 mil-
lion, that extra fraction letting the producers 
pay for (and thus own) the OCR outright. Or 
a new label might syndicate the costs and 
profits among a group of investors. (The 
boutique label Broadway Records has its 
own variation on these paradigms.) The up-
side for the labels is obvious: Taking a fee or 
a royalty, they are much less exposed to risk. 
The upside for the producers (and for the 
artists as well) is that they have a permanent 
record of work they may love, or at any rate 
hope to profit by in the future. A show 
creamed by the New York critics might yet 
live on in high schools and regional the-
aters—if there’s an OCR to spread the word. 

This is good news for a show like Tamar 
of the River, which played barely a month 
Off–Off Broadway in 2013 despite one of the 
most extraordinary new scores in years. 
Now others can hear it and produce it. But 
is it good news for the rest of us that, say, 
Doctor Zhivago, last season’s worst Broad-
way musical, is also preserved? There’s a 
reason most flops flop, and sometimes all an 
OCR can do is show you why—forever. ■

in at least every extra literary

anticipated City on Fire arrives unmistak-
ably marked as a very big deal. A $2 million 
book contract; film rights sold on the spot; 
911 pages with deluxe fictional facsimiles of 
a DIY zine, handwritten letters, and faux-
whiskey-stained typewritten manuscripts; 
advance author profiles in Vogue, this maga-
zine, and who knows where else—whatever 
the book tells us about itself or the state of 
the American novel, it says a lot about what 
sort of story New York publishers and Hol-

also historical, and there-

live now but instead delivering a nostalgic 
view of the way we may like to believe we 
lived then; a soft focus on both the perenni-
ally fascinating ultrarich as well as two 
bygone bohemias (punk rock and the down-
town art scene); a dizzying, schizophrenic 
approach to point of view, with the narrative 
shifting among dozens of characters, some 
of them very minor, every few pages; a thrill-
erish structure pitting sad heroes against 
sadistic villains; and a recurring retreat at 
crucial moments from realism to Disney-
land logic, right down to the wicked step-
mother. As you can possibly tell, I’m not sold 
on City on Fire, but I’m curious to see if the 
reading public proves the enthusiasts right 
in their bet that this is the big novel—in its 
overflowing nostalgia, period-piece 
fetishization, and sheer physical bulk—
everyone wants to read right now. As a book 
editor who read City on Fire on submission 
told me, “Christian, most people are more 
sentimental than you.”

For a book so long, the plot is pretty sim-
ple, if also a bit flimsy. City on Fire is over-
stuffed with characters, and the lines of 
action uniting them fray to the point of 
breaking. There is a girl in a coma, Saman-
tha, shot in Central Park on New Year’s Eve 
as 1976 turned to 1977. She’s an NYU fresh-
man enmeshed with a group of punks who 
live in a squat on East Third Street and call 
themselves the Post -Humanists. Their 
leader is Nicky Chaos, who has usurped the 
remains of a punk band, Ex Post Facto, from 
its former front man, Billy Three-Sticks, who 
has retreated from music into painting and 
a heroin habit. Billy is actually William 
Hamilton-Sweeney, scion of a family that’s 
also been the object of a hostile takeover at 
the hands of his wicked stepmother, Felicia 
Gould, and her “demon brother,” Amory. In 
addition to framing William’s father for 
insider trading, Amory is working in league 
with Nicky, who is having William followed 
by punk spies. Nicky is also at work on a proj-
ect of his own, building a bomb with explo-
sives stolen from Samantha’s father, a fire-
works maestro. A few questions mount: Will 
Samantha survive her coma? Who shot her? 
Why is the novel set in 1977? What do the 
tribulations of the hypercapitalist Hamilton- 
Sweeneys have to do with punk music? And 
why on earth is the novel so long?

The answer to the last question, I think, is 
that Hallberg has erected a few hundred 
pages’ worth of a historical thriller in the 
interest of propping up reams and reams of 
backstories for characters major and minor. 
There is at first an appealing uptown- 
downtown, bridge-and-tunnel (and ferry) 
diversity to the cast, but it yields to a perva-
sive melancholy. Most of the backward-
looking exposition homes in on the sources 
of their sadness, and in the case of the major 

characters, these take the form of a lost par-
ent. William Hamilton-Sweeney and his 
sister, Regan, lost their mother to a car acci-
dent in the early 1950s. Samantha’s mother 
left her and her father to run off with her 
yoga instructor. Samantha’s best friend, 
Charlie, an adopted Long Island teenager, 
lost his father to a heart attack, lending the 
family home a “forcefield of sadness.” City on 
Fire is billed as a 1970s punk fantasia, but 
the vibe of the novel is less punk than emo. 

Then there’s the book’s take on punk itself. 
For Samantha and Charlie, sneaking into 
the city from Long Island to see shows on 
the Bowery, the music is a liberating force. 
There are many reverent mentions of Patti 
Smith, Television, the Ramones, Richard 
Hell and the Voidoids, the Sex Pistols, and 
the Clash. But Hallberg’s original contribu-
tion is the story of Ex Post Facto. We’re told 
the band was started as a lark by William 
and his friends the transvestite keyboardist 
Venus de Nylon, the bassist Nastanovich (if 
this isn’t a reference to real-life Pavement 
member Bob Nas tanovich, the coincidence 
is a bit glaring), and drummer Big Mike. For 
them, punk is a way to pass the time between 
more serious artistic pursuits (in William’s 
case, his painting) and developing heroin 
habits. The band is taken over and its spirit 
betrayed by Nicky Chaos, a fan who offers 
them a practice space and turns out to be a 
cokehead careerist and a criminal special-
izing in arson, later emerging as something 
of a cult leader, with Samantha and Charlie 
joining his quasi-revolutionary cell, which 
lands Samantha in her coma and makes 
Charlie an accomplice to serial acts of 
arson—a far cry from the life he’d envisioned 
a few months earlier as a Bowie-listening 
high-school student resigned to someday 
becoming “an accountant or a podiatrist.” 
Charlie eventually breaks with Nicky after 
they set fire to a building inside which a dog 
is trapped. For the teenage runaway, killing 
an innocent animal is a step too far.

The novel’s configuration of punk as a 
rich kid’s hobby betrayed by violent thugs is 
a curious choice and less than convincing, 
both because it cuts against the varied class 
origins of actual punks (Patti Smith is the 
daughter of a waitress and a factory worker; 
Sid Vicious, a working-class high-school 
dropout; Richard Hell and Tom Verlaine 
middle-class, etc.) and because it under-
mines the romantic vision of punk Hallberg 
works to establish at the start. The rest of 
Hallberg’s efforts to establish a period 1970s 
atmosphere are even more pained. It’s hard 
to say that anything’s exactly anachronistic, 
but many of the period details ostenta-
tiously mentioned have the effect of weak-
ening the book’s claim to authenticity 
because they feel so generic and therefore 
secondhand. Back then, pedestrian traffic 
signals featured the words walk and don’t 
walk; there were hookers on the street; it 
was a relatively new thing to have a color 
television, and there were commercials for 
popular processed foods like Velveeta 
cheese; quaaludes were available; buildings 
in Hell’s Kitchen looked like they’d been hit 
by bombs and were occupied by Hells 
Angels; muggings were a regular hazard. 
References to iconic works of the time—
Taxi Driver, The French Connection, John le 
Carré’s novels—only serve to remind us that 
we’re not really there.

Centered as it is on a wealthy family’s 
Central Park penthouse, on the one hand, 
and a dingy downtown squat on the other, 
Hallberg’s vision of 1977 Manhattan is 
drenched in nostalgia, a ramshackle 
 pastiche—part potboiler, part soap opera, 
and, in largest part, a close study of a hand-
ful of characters (not to mention an array of 
stock characters: an alcoholic journalist, a 
plucky gallery assistant, a crippled Polish 
cop just a few weeks from retirement who 
stays on the job to crack one last case), an 
exercise in the novel as group-therapy ses-
sion. Strangely, for a story told from so many 
points of view, the narrative voice is uniform 
throughout, jaunty and knowing, peppered 
with $5 words and rhetorical questions, but 
it’s never very funny and never comes very 
close to the consciousness of whatever char-
acter it’s inhabiting at any given time. What 
the characters have in common is a perva-
sive ennui. Containing these people inside a 
thriller requires many violations of logic and 
resorts to cliché. Ultimately, Hallberg is try-
ing to have it too many ways. There’s a 
strong tradition of social novels of New York 
City—from William Dean Howells’s A Haz-
ard of New Fortunes and the novels of Edith 
Wharton to  DeLillo’s Underworld and the 
novels of Jonathan Lethem—built on near 
overdoses of naturalistic detail. Hallberg has 
tried to yoke the genre to what one character 
calls a “fairy tale.”  ■

TV

1. Watch American 
Horror Story: Hotel
Fifth season, still a fright.  

FX, October 7 at 10 p.m. 

The horror anthology returns with a narratively 
(and geographically) tighter focus: the Hotel Cor-
tez in L.A., owned by guest star Lady Gaga and 
possibly the center of action for the mysterious 
Ten Commandments Killer. Look for connections 
between new stories and earlier ones: The Mur-
der House from season one makes a cameo, along 
with regulars like Kathy Bates, Angela Bassett, 
and Sarah Paulson. matt zoller seitz

POP

2. Listen to Chvrches’ 
Every Open Eye
Like Pat Benatar in another galaxy. 

Glassnote. 

This Scottish synth-pop trio stormed the scene 
about two years ago with their sleek, infectious 
debut. Their latest improves on that winning for-
mula, marrying the aerodynamic sheen of mod-
ern electronic  music with the huge, open-hearted 
hooks of ’80s rock. lindsay zoladz 

ART

3. See Maureen Gallace
Stunning simplicity.  

303 Gallery, through October 31. 

For years, even art’s muckety-mucks have been 
unable to explain Maureen Gallace’s simple de-
pictions and painterly techniques. Long known 
for juicy images of beaches, seascapes, barns, 
flowers, and the like, Gallace here is beautifully in 
touch with the deepest aspects of observation and 

light-infused color; her new work stands on its 
own, noble, to be savored. jerry saltz

THEATER

4. See Hamlet
Starring an especially sweet prince.  

See ntlive.nationaltheatre.org.uk for venues;
October 15 at 7 p.m. 

For some, Lyndsey Turner’s direction is the draw 
that has turned the Barbican’s Hamlet into Lon-
don’s hottest ticket this fall; for others, it’s more 
likely the star, Benedict Cumberbatch. The run is 
basically sold out, and the theater is 3,500 miles 
away, so catch the National Theatre’s live broadcast.

POP

5. Listen to Demi 
Lovato’s Confdent
Pop conqueror.  

Hollywood/Island, October 16. 

This aptly titled album just might be the fall’s best 
pop. Take a listen to the first two singles: the 
slinky earworm “Cool for the Summer” and the 
title song, a boisterous Max Martin production 
about letting your freak flag fly high. 

MOVIES

6. See The Final Girls
Don’t go up that staircase!  

In theaters October 9. 

Ever since Carol Clover ID’d the archetype in her 
1991 book Men, Women, and Chainsaws, the idea 
of the “final girl”—the one who faces the monster 
after all her friends have been hacked up—has 
been a cliché. It’s an archetype that comes in for a 
ribbing in this macabre meta-horror comedy, in 
which a high-school senior is whisked back in time

TV

7. Watch Fargo
It’s a doozie.  

FX, October 12 at 10 p.m. 

Season one had its guilty pleasures (we miss you, 
Billy Bob Thornton!), but Fargo digs deeper in 
season two, giving us Solverson-family history, the 
Sioux Falls incident, and new cast members like 
Kirsten Dunst, Patrick Wilson, and Ted Danson. 

OPERA

8. Hear Elektra
Watch the baton.  

Carnegie Hall, October 21. 

As the Philharmonic mulls its future, the city is 
caught in a pincer of conductorial excitement. 
Shortly after Yannick Nézet-Séguin finishes Otello 
at the Met, Andris Nelsons brings his Boston Sym-
phony Orchestra for another operatic tour de force. 
Christine Goerke headlines a big-lunged cast for 
this concert performance. justin davidson

MOVIES

9. See Everest
Reaching great heights. 

In theaters. 

Imax-worthy vistas notwithstanding, this latest 
dramatization of the 1996 catastrophe portrayed 
in Jon Krakauer’s Into Thin Air is notable for its 
tragic intimacy. The Icelandic director Baltasar 
Kormákur doesn’t lose sight of the real, small, sad 
story at his big movie’s heart. bilge ebiri

BOOKS

10. Read Sloane Crosley’s 
The Clasp
The genuine article.  

Farrar, Straus & Giroux. 

The breezy New York essayist hasn’t radically al-
tered her voice in transit to fiction. That’s good, 
because Crosley’s skittery wit and polished 
warmth make her first novel worthy of its meta-
fictional basis, de Maupassant’s “The Necklace.”         
                     boris kachka

THEATER

11. See The Christians
A megachurch worth attending.  

Playwrights Horizons, through October 11. 

Lucas Hnath’s good-strange new play, about a pas-
tor who no longer believes in hell, is most extraor-
dinary in the way it wrestles seriously with a fun-
damental (not just a fundamentalist) question: 
How do we change and yet remain faithful? j.g.

POP

12. See Majical Cloudz
Make eye contact.  

National Sawdust, October 21. 

The Montreal electropop duo have one of the sim-
plest and most affecting live shows currently tour-
ing; the airy and pristine new National Sawdust 
space should be the perfect backdrop for this musi-
cal theater of vulnerability. l.z.

13. See Rocco and  
His Brothers
Remarkable restoration. 

Film Forum, October 9 through 29. 

As part of its 25th anniversary, Milestone pres-
ents Luchino Visconti’s rare 1960 epic, a madly 
ambitious take on Dostoyevsky’s The Idiot that’s 
more operatic (and arguably less successful) 
than his masterpiece, The Leopard. But you need 
to see it to understand the bar Visconti set for 
those passionate Italian-American movie buffs 
Scorsese and Coppola. d.e.

CLASSICAL MUSIC

14. Hear Mark Padmore
Singularly soulful music. 

Alice Tully Hall, October 14 through 17. 

With his limpid voice, crystalline diction, and 
vast emotive range, tenor Mark Padmore suf-
fuses Schubert’s songs with pain and bliss; he’ll 
perform the composer’s three song cycles at the 
White Light Festival. j.d.

TV

15. Watch Red Oaks
Here come the popped collars.

Amazon, October 9. 

David Gordon Green directed this ten-episode se-
ries set at a country club in 1985, where a young 
assistant tennis pro is spending his final summer 
before college; the slam-dunk cast includes Richard 
Kind and Jennifer Grey as the hero’s parents, plus 
Paul Reiser as a yuppie corporate raider. m.z.s.

BOOKS

16. Read Salman 
Rushdie
Reconsider the serial tweeter.  

Random House. 

In Two Years Eight Months and Twenty-eight

his strongest novel in years: a clever, pomo- 
mystical triptych stretching back to Andalusia 
and forward to a distant utopian future. b.k.

17. See Keltie Ferris
Painterly reflexes engaged. 

Mitchell-Innes & Nash, through October 17. 

Ferris burst onto the New York painting scene 
with Day-Glo canvases that were perfect crosses 
between hazy 1970s color-field painting, pixelat-
ed digital space breaking up and reforming, and 
painterly abstraction; then she seemed to plateau 
a bit. That temporary stall is behind her; Ferris is 
really simmering-to-boil in this new show. j.s.

19. See The Pirates  
of Penzance  
The very model of an operetta. 

New York City Center, October 15 and 16. 

Gilbert’s pearls of inconsequence and Sullivan’s 
sublime melodies usually get buried under de-
cades of dull performance clichés. Expect more 
from MasterVoices and the Orchestra of St.

when they serve up the spoof of 19th-century no-
tions of duty. j.g.

First-person filmmaking.

BAMcinématek, October 7 through 14. 

Thanks to digital video, “diary” films are now a 
cinch to make, but as BAM’s series makes clear, 
that wasn’t always so. Explore this exhilarating 
tradition onscreen, from Ed Pincus’s hugely influ-

For just one night.

Carnegie Hall, October 19. 

Legendary storyteller Scheherazade gives her

this all-star concert of both Ravel’s and Rimsky- 
Korsakov’s versions of Scheherazade. j.d.

25. Watch Manhattan
It’s the bomb. 

 WGN, October 13 at 9 p.m. 

Even though you know how this show will end, the 
race to build the bomb makes for engrossing tele-
vision. Season two, anchored by John Benjamin 
Hickey’s unhinged performance, gives a tour of 
minds both brilliant and paranoid; you’ll start to 
believe one can’t exist without the other.

WHILE MOST Caribbean destinations 

offer miles of white sandy beaches and 

calm cerulean seas, few are considered 

as welcoming and friendly as the 

Cayman Islands. The destination’s 

unique “Caymankind” culture truly 

sets it apart from anywhere else in the 

world. From the islands’ people and 

cultural traditions to its hospitality and 

impeccable service, the “Caymankind” 

way of life is what keeps visitors 

returning year after year.

The islands are easily accessible 

in under four hours and hassle-free 

for those traveling from New York 

City and Newark, NJ, with several 

nonstop fl ights departing via Cayman 

Airways, JetBlue, or United Airlines to 

Grand Cayman.

The Cayman Islands presents the 

perfect getaway for any type of 

traveler or occasion. With vibrant coral 

reefs and crystal-clear waters ideal 

for superior snorkeling and scuba 

diving experiences, and an endless 

assortment of cultural events—not 

to mention world-class restaurants 

and memorable local eateries—the 

Cayman Islands is an unparalleled 

Caribbean luxury destination. 

Visitors can also experience 

the excitement of a multi-island 

vacation by jetting off to the two 

Sister Islands during their stay, 

Cayman Brac and Little Cayman. 

Both just a quick plane ride away, 

these islands are heralded for their 

awe-inspiring scenic views, remote 

beaches, exceptional dive sites, and 

memorable wildlife encounters.

To nominate an outstanding home professional 
for next year’s award, go to www.fivestarprofessional.com.

Know a great home professional?

Five Star Professional conducts market-specific research throughout the U.S. to 
identify real estate agents, mortgage professionals and home/auto insurance 
professionals who demonstrate professional excellence and provide quality service 
to their clients. Now entering its twelfth year, the Five Star award program is the 

largest and most widely published award in the industry, covering more than 40 major U.S. markets.

The Five Star Professional research team contacted thousands of recent homebuyers, consumers and industry experts to 
identify New York City-area service professionals who stand out in their industry and community. Award candidates for the 
Five Star award are brought forward based on consumer evaluations, peer nominations and/or based on superior industry 
credentials (based on experience and historical production).

Phone and online survey respondents submit evaluations rating their service professional on criteria such as overall 
satisfaction, customer service skills, market knowledge and whether they would recommend the professional to a friend.

Award recipients represent less than 7 percent of professionals in the Greater New York City area and demonstrate 
professional excellence and a commitment to customer service.

This year’s winners are listed and profiled in the following pages. They can also be found, along with more on our research 
methodology, on our website at FiveStarProfessional.com.

•  The 2015 Five Star Real Estate Agents, Mortgage Professionals and Home/Auto Insurance Professionals do not pay a fee to be 
included in the research or the final list.

•  Each professional is screened against state governing bodies to verify that licenses are current, and no disciplinary actions 
are pending. 

•  The inclusion of a real estate agent, mortgage professional or insurance professional on the final lists should not be construed 
as an endorsement by Five Star Professional or New York Magazine.

•  The research process incorporates a statistically valid sample in order to identify the professionals in the local market who 
score highest in overall satisfaction. These professionals are not included on the list unless their score is statistically valid.

For more information on the Five Star award and the research/selection methodology, go to www.fivestarprofessional.com.
